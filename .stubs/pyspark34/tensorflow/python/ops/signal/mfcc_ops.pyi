def mfccs_from_log_mel_spectrograms(log_mel_spectrograms, name: Incomplete | None = None):
    """Computes [MFCCs][mfcc] of `log_mel_spectrograms`.

  Implemented with GPU-compatible ops and supports gradients.

  [Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC)][mfcc] calculation consists of
  taking the DCT-II of a log-magnitude mel-scale spectrogram. [HTK][htk]'s MFCCs
  use a particular scaling of the DCT-II which is almost orthogonal
  normalization. We follow this convention.

  All `num_mel_bins` MFCCs are returned and it is up to the caller to select
  a subset of the MFCCs based on their application. For example, it is typical
  to only use the first few for speech recognition, as this results in
  an approximately pitch-invariant representation of the signal.

  For example:

  ```python
  batch_size, num_samples, sample_rate = 32, 32000, 16000.0
  # A Tensor of [batch_size, num_samples] mono PCM samples in the range [-1, 1].
  pcm = tf.random.normal([batch_size, num_samples], dtype=tf.float32)

  # A 1024-point STFT with frames of 64 ms and 75% overlap.
  stfts = tf.signal.stft(pcm, frame_length=1024, frame_step=256,
                         fft_length=1024)
  spectrograms = tf.abs(stfts)

  # Warp the linear scale spectrograms into the mel-scale.
  num_spectrogram_bins = stfts.shape[-1].value
  lower_edge_hertz, upper_edge_hertz, num_mel_bins = 80.0, 7600.0, 80
  linear_to_mel_weight_matrix = tf.signal.linear_to_mel_weight_matrix(
    num_mel_bins, num_spectrogram_bins, sample_rate, lower_edge_hertz,
    upper_edge_hertz)
  mel_spectrograms = tf.tensordot(
    spectrograms, linear_to_mel_weight_matrix, 1)
  mel_spectrograms.set_shape(spectrograms.shape[:-1].concatenate(
    linear_to_mel_weight_matrix.shape[-1:]))

  # Compute a stabilized log to get log-magnitude mel-scale spectrograms.
  log_mel_spectrograms = tf.math.log(mel_spectrograms + 1e-6)

  # Compute MFCCs from log_mel_spectrograms and take the first 13.
  mfccs = tf.signal.mfccs_from_log_mel_spectrograms(
    log_mel_spectrograms)[..., :13]
  ```

  Args:
    log_mel_spectrograms: A `[..., num_mel_bins]` `float32`/`float64` `Tensor`
      of log-magnitude mel-scale spectrograms.
    name: An optional name for the operation.
  Returns:
    A `[..., num_mel_bins]` `float32`/`float64` `Tensor` of the MFCCs of
    `log_mel_spectrograms`.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If `num_mel_bins` is not positive.
