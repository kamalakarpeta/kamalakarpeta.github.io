def register_tensor_conversion_function(base_type, conversion_func, priority: int = 100) -> None:
    """Registers a function for converting objects of `base_type` to `Tensor`.

  The conversion function must have the following signature:

  ```python
      def conversion_func(value, dtype=None, name=None, as_ref=False):
        # ...
  ```

  It must return a `Tensor` with the given `dtype` if specified. If the
  conversion function creates a new `Tensor`, it should use the given
  `name` if specified. All exceptions will be propagated to the caller.

  The conversion function may return `NotImplemented` for some
  inputs. In this case, the conversion process will continue to try
  subsequent conversion functions.

  If `as_ref` is true, the function must return a `Tensor` reference,
  such as a `Variable`.

  NOTE: The conversion functions will execute in order of priority,
  followed by order of registration. To ensure that a conversion function
  `F` runs before another conversion function `G`, ensure that `F` is
  registered with a smaller priority than `G`.

  Args:
    base_type: The base type or tuple of base types for all objects that
      `conversion_func` accepts.
    conversion_func: A function that converts instances of `base_type` to
      `Tensor`.
    priority: Optional integer that indicates the priority for applying this
      conversion function. Conversion functions with smaller priority values run
      earlier than conversion functions with larger priority values. Defaults to
      100.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If the arguments do not have the appropriate type.
  """
def get(query):
    """Get conversion function for objects of `cls`.

  Args:
    query: The type to query for.

  Returns:
    A list of conversion functions in increasing order of priority.
