  Args:
    graph_or_graph_def: A `Graph` or a `GraphDef` protocol buffer.
    logdir: Directory where to write the graph. This can refer to remote
      filesystems, such as Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
    name: Filename for the graph.
    as_text: If `True`, writes the graph as an ASCII proto.

  Returns:
    The path of the output proto file.
