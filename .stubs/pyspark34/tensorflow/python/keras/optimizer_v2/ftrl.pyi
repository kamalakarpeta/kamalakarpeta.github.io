class Ftrl(optimizer_v2.OptimizerV2):
    '''Optimizer that implements the FTRL algorithm.

  "Follow The Regularized Leader" (FTRL) is an optimization algorithm developed
  at Google for click-through rate prediction in the early 2010s. It is most
  suitable for shallow models with large and sparse feature spaces.
  The algorithm is described by
  [McMahan et al., 2013](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/41159.pdf).
  The Keras version has support for both online L2 regularization
  (the L2 regularization described in the paper
  above) and shrinkage-type L2 regularization
  (which is the addition of an L2 penalty to the loss function).

  Initialization:

  ```python
  n = 0
  sigma = 0
  z = 0
  ```

  Update rule for one variable `w`:

  ```python
  prev_n = n
  n = n + g ** 2
  sigma = (sqrt(n) - sqrt(prev_n)) / lr
  z = z + g - sigma * w
  if abs(z) < lambda_1:
    w = 0
  else:
    w = (sgn(z) * lambda_1 - z) / ((beta + sqrt(n)) / alpha + lambda_2)
  ```

  Notation:

  - `lr` is the learning rate
  - `g` is the gradient for the variable
  - `lambda_1` is the L1 regularization strength
  - `lambda_2` is the L2 regularization strength

  Check the documentation for the `l2_shrinkage_regularization_strength`
  parameter for more details when shrinkage is enabled, in which case gradient
  is replaced with a gradient with shrinkage.

  Args:
    learning_rate: A `Tensor`, floating point value, or a schedule that is a
      `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.LearningRateSchedule`. The learning rate.
    learning_rate_power: A float value, must be less or equal to zero.
      Controls how the learning rate decreases during training. Use zero for
      a fixed learning rate.
    initial_accumulator_value: The starting value for accumulators.
      Only zero or positive values are allowed.
    l1_regularization_strength: A float value, must be greater than or
      equal to zero. Defaults to 0.0.
    l2_regularization_strength: A float value, must be greater than or
      equal to zero. Defaults to 0.0.
    name: Optional name prefix for the operations created when applying
      gradients.  Defaults to `"Ftrl"`.
    l2_shrinkage_regularization_strength: A float value, must be greater than
      or equal to zero. This differs from L2 above in that the L2 above is a
      stabilization penalty, whereas this L2 shrinkage is a magnitude penalty.
      When input is sparse shrinkage will only happen on the active weights.
    beta: A float value, representing the beta value from the paper.
      Defaults to 0.0.
    **kwargs: Keyword arguments. Allowed to be one of
      `"clipnorm"` or `"clipvalue"`.
      `"clipnorm"` (float) clips gradients by norm; `"clipvalue"` (float) clips
      gradients by value.
