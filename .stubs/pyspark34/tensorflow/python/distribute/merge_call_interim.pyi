  The caller of this utility function requests to invoke `fn` via `merge_call`

  whether the request is honored, depending on the `Strategy`. See
  `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.merge_call()` for more information.

  Args:
    fn: the function to be invoked.
    strategy: the `tf.distribute.Strategy` to call `fn` with.
    *args: the positional arguments to be passed in to `fn`.
    **kwargs: the keyword arguments to be passed in to `fn`.

  Returns:
    The return value of the `fn` call.
