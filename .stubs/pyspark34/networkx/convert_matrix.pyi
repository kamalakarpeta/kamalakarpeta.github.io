    """Returns the graph adjacency matrix as a Pandas DataFrame.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        The NetworkX graph used to construct the Pandas DataFrame.

    nodelist : list, optional
       The rows and columns are ordered according to the nodes in `nodelist`.
       If `nodelist` is None, then the ordering is produced by G.nodes().

    multigraph_weight : {sum, min, max}, optional
        An operator that determines how weights in multigraphs are handled.
        The default is to sum the weights of the multiple edges.

    weight : string or None, optional
        The edge attribute that holds the numerical value used for
        the edge weight.  If an edge does not have that attribute, then the
        value 1 is used instead.

    nonedge : float, optional
        The matrix values corresponding to nonedges are typically set to zero.
        However, this could be undesirable if there are matrix values
        corresponding to actual edges that also have the value zero. If so,
        one might prefer nonedges to have some other value, such as nan.

    Returns
    -------
    df : Pandas DataFrame
       Graph adjacency matrix

    Notes
    -----
    For directed graphs, entry i,j corresponds to an edge from i to j.

    The DataFrame entries are assigned to the weight edge attribute. When
    an edge does not have a weight attribute, the value of the entry is set to
    the number 1.  For multiple (parallel) edges, the values of the entries
    are determined by the 'multigraph_weight' parameter.  The default is to
    sum the weight attributes for each of the parallel edges.

    When `nodelist` does not contain every node in `G`, the matrix is built
    from the subgraph of `G` that is induced by the nodes in `nodelist`.

    The convention used for self-loop edges in graphs is to assign the
    diagonal matrix entry value to the weight attribute of the edge
    (or the number 1 if the edge has no weight attribute).  If the
    alternate convention of doubling the edge weight is desired the
    resulting Pandas DataFrame can be modified as follows:

    >>> pd.options.display.max_columns = 20
    >>> import numpy as np

    -------
    A : SciPy sparse array
       Graph adjacency matrix.

    Notes
    -----
    For directed graphs, matrix entry i,j corresponds to an edge from i to j.

    The matrix entries are populated using the edge attribute held in
    parameter weight. When an edge does not have that attribute, the
    value of the entry is 1.

    For multiple edges the matrix values are the sums of the edge weights.

    When `nodelist` does not contain every node in `G`, the adjacency matrix
    is built from the subgraph of `G` that is induced by the nodes in
    `nodelist`.

    The convention used for self-loop edges in graphs is to assign the
    diagonal matrix entry value to the weight attribute of the edge
    (or the number 1 if the edge has no weight attribute).  If the
    alternate convention of doubling the edge weight is desired the
    resulting SciPy sparse array can be modified as follows:

    >>> print(A.todense())
    [[1]]
    >>> A.setdiag(A.diagonal() * 2)

    ----------
    A: scipy.sparse array
      An adjacency matrix representation of a graph

    parallel_edges : Boolean
      If this is True, `create_using` is a multigraph, and `A` is an

    edge_attribute: string

    Notes
    -----
    For directed graphs, explicitly mention create_using=nx.DiGraph,

    In this case, `edge_attribute` will be ignored.

    If `create_using` indicates an undirected multigraph, then only the edges
    indicated by the upper triangle of the matrix `A` will be added to the

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import scipy as sp

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        The NetworkX graph used to construct the NumPy array.

    nodelist : list, optional
        The rows and columns are ordered according to the nodes in `nodelist`.
        If `nodelist` is ``None``, then the ordering is produced by ``G.nodes()``.

    dtype : NumPy data type, optional
        A NumPy data type used to initialize the array. If None, then the NumPy
        default is used. The dtype can be structured if `weight=None`, in which
        case the dtype field names are used to look up edge attributes. The
        result is a structured array where each named field in the dtype
        corresponds to the adjacency for that edge attribute. See examples for
        details.

    order : {\'C\', \'F\'}, optional
        Whether to store multidimensional data in C- or Fortran-contiguous
        (row- or column-wise) order in memory. If None, then the NumPy default
        is used.

    multigraph_weight : callable, optional
        An function that determines how weights in multigraphs are handled.
        The function should accept a sequence of weights and return a single
        value. The default is to sum the weights of the multiple edges.

    weight : string or None optional (default = \'weight\')
        The edge attribute that holds the numerical value used for
        the edge weight. If an edge does not have that attribute, then the
        value 1 is used instead. `weight` must be ``None`` if a structured
        dtype is used.

    nonedge : array_like (default = 0.0)
        The value used to represent non-edges in the adjacency matrix.
        The array values corresponding to nonedges are typically set to zero.
        However, this could be undesirable if there are array values
        corresponding to actual edges that also have the value zero. If so,
        one might prefer nonedges to have some other value, such as ``nan``.

    Returns
    -------
    A : NumPy ndarray
        Graph adjacency matrix

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `dtype` is a structured dtype and `G` is a multigraph
    ValueError
        If `dtype` is a structured dtype and `weight` is not `None`

    See Also
    --------
    from_numpy_array

    Notes
    -----
    For directed graphs, entry ``i, j`` corresponds to an edge from ``i`` to ``j``.

    Entries in the adjacency matrix are given by the `weight` edge attribute.
    When an edge does not have a weight attribute, the value of the entry is
    set to the number 1.  For multiple (parallel) edges, the values of the
    entries are determined by the `multigraph_weight` parameter. The default is
    to sum the weight attributes for each of the parallel edges.

    When `nodelist` does not contain every node in `G`, the adjacency matrix is
    built from the subgraph of `G` that is induced by the nodes in `nodelist`.

    The convention used for self-loop edges in graphs is to assign the
    diagonal array entry value to the weight attribute of the edge
    (or the number 1 if the edge has no weight attribute). If the
    alternate convention of doubling the edge weight is desired the
    resulting NumPy array can be modified as follows:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 1)])
    >>> A = nx.to_numpy_array(G)
    >>> A
    array([[1.]])
    >>> A[np.diag_indices_from(A)] *= 2
    >>> A
    array([[2.]])

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.MultiDiGraph()
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 1, weight=2)
    0
    >>> G.add_edge(1, 0)
    0
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 2, weight=3)
    0
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 2)
    1
    >>> nx.to_numpy_array(G, nodelist=[0, 1, 2])
    array([[0., 2., 0.],
           [1., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 4.]])

    When `nodelist` argument is used, nodes of `G` which do not appear in the `nodelist`
    and their edges are not included in the adjacency matrix. Here is an example:

    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> G.add_edge(3, 1)
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 0)
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 1)
    >>> G.add_edge(3, 0)
    >>> nx.to_numpy_array(G, nodelist=[1, 2, 3])
    array([[0., 1., 1.],
           [1., 0., 0.],
           [1., 0., 0.]])

    This function can also be used to create adjacency matrices for multiple
    edge attributes with structured dtypes:

    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 1, weight=10)
    >>> G.add_edge(1, 2, cost=5)
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 3, weight=3, cost=-4.0)
    >>> dtype = np.dtype([("weight", int), ("cost", float)])
    >>> A = nx.to_numpy_array(G, dtype=dtype, weight=None)
    >>> A["weight"]
    array([[ 0, 10,  0,  0],
           [10,  0,  1,  0],
           [ 0,  1,  0,  3],
           [ 0,  0,  3,  0]])
    >>> A["cost"]
    array([[ 0.,  1.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 1.,  0.,  5.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  5.,  0., -4.],
           [ 0.,  0., -4.,  0.]])

    As stated above, the argument "nonedge" is useful especially when there are
    actually edges with weight 0 in the graph. Setting a nonedge value different than 0,
    makes it much clearer to differentiate such 0-weighted edges and actual nonedge values.

    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> G.add_edge(3, 1, weight=2)
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 0, weight=0)
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 1, weight=0)

def from_numpy_array(A, parallel_edges: bool = False, create_using: Incomplete | None = None, edge_attr: str = 'weight'):
    '''Returns a graph from a 2D NumPy array.

    The 2D NumPy array is interpreted as an adjacency matrix for the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : a 2D numpy.ndarray
        An adjacency matrix representation of a graph

    parallel_edges : Boolean
        If this is True, `create_using` is a multigraph, and `A` is an
        integer array, then entry *(i, j)* in the array is interpreted as the
        number of parallel edges joining vertices *i* and *j* in the graph.
        If it is False, then the entries in the array are interpreted as
        the weight of a single edge joining the vertices.

    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    edge_attr : String, optional (default="weight")
        The attribute to which the array values are assigned on each edge. If
        it is None, edge attributes will not be assigned.

    Notes
    -----
    For directed graphs, explicitly mention create_using=nx.DiGraph,
    and entry i,j of A corresponds to an edge from i to j.

    If `create_using` is :class:`networkx.MultiGraph` or
    :class:`networkx.MultiDiGraph`, `parallel_edges` is True, and the
    entries of `A` are of type :class:`int`, then this function returns a
    multigraph (of the same type as `create_using`) with parallel edges.

    If `create_using` indicates an undirected multigraph, then only the edges
    indicated by the upper triangle of the array `A` will be added to the
    graph.

    If `edge_attr` is Falsy (False or None), edge attributes will not be
    assigned, and the array data will be treated like a binary mask of
    edge presence or absence. Otherwise, the attributes will be assigned
    as follows:

    If the NumPy array has a single data type for each array entry it
    will be converted to an appropriate Python data type.

    If the NumPy array has a user-specified compound data type the names
    of the data fields will be used as attribute keys in the resulting
    NetworkX graph.

    Examples
    --------
    Simple integer weights on edges:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> A = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 1]])
    >>> G = nx.from_numpy_array(A)
    >>> G.edges(data=True)
    EdgeDataView([(0, 0, {\'weight\': 1}), (0, 1, {\'weight\': 2}), (1, 1, {\'weight\': 1})])

    If `create_using` indicates a multigraph and the array has only integer
    entries and `parallel_edges` is False, then the entries will be treated
    as weights for edges joining the nodes (without creating parallel edges):

    >>> A = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2]])
    >>> G = nx.from_numpy_array(A, create_using=nx.MultiGraph)
    >>> G[1][1]
    AtlasView({0: {\'weight\': 2}})

    If `create_using` indicates a multigraph and the array has only integer
    entries and `parallel_edges` is True, then the entries will be treated
    as the number of parallel edges joining those two vertices:

    >>> A = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2]])
    >>> temp = nx.MultiGraph()
    >>> G = nx.from_numpy_array(A, parallel_edges=True, create_using=temp)
    >>> G[1][1]
    AtlasView({0: {\'weight\': 1}, 1: {\'weight\': 1}})

    User defined compound data type on edges:

    >>> dt = [("weight", float), ("cost", int)]
    >>> A = np.array([[(1.0, 2)]], dtype=dt)
    >>> G = nx.from_numpy_array(A)
    >>> G.edges()
    EdgeView([(0, 0)])
    >>> G[0][0]["cost"]
    2
    >>> G[0][0]["weight"]
    1.0
