    Returns the total weight of a branching.

    You must access this function through the networkx.algorithms.tree module.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph
        The directed graph.
    attr : str
        The attribute to use as weights. If None, then each edge will be
        treated equally with a weight of 1.
    default : float

        `default` specifies what value it should take.

    Returns
    -------
    weight: int or float
        The total weight of the branching.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G.add_weighted_edges_from([(0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 4), (2, 3, 3), (3, 4, 2)])

    Returns a branching obtained through a greedy algorithm.

    This algorithm is wrong, and cannot give a proper optimal branching.
    However, we include it for pedagogical reasons, as it can be helpful to
    see what its outputs are.

    The output is a branching, and possibly, a spanning arborescence. However,
    it is not guaranteed to be optimal in either case.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph
        The directed graph to scan.
    attr : str
        The attribute to use as weights. If None, then each edge will be
        treated equally with a weight of 1.
    default : float
        When `attr` is not None, then if an edge does not have that attribute,
        `default` specifies what value it should take.
    kind : str
        The type of optimum to search for: 'min' or 'max' greedy branching.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)

    Returns
    -------
    B : directed graph

    Notes
    -----
    While this algorithm can find a minimum branching, since it isn't required
    to be spanning, the minimum branching is always from the set of negative
    weight edges which is most likely the empty set for most graphs.
