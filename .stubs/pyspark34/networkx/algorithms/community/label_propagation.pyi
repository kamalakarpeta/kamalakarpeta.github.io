def fast_label_propagation_communities(G, *, weight: Incomplete | None = None, seed: Incomplete | None = None) -> Generator[Incomplete, Incomplete, None]:
    '''Returns communities in `G` as detected by fast label propagation.

    The fast label propagation algorithm is described in [1]_. The algorithm is
    probabilistic and the found communities may vary in different executions.

    The algorithm operates as follows. First, the community label of each node is
    set to a unique label. The algorithm then repeatedly updates the labels of
    the nodes to the most frequent label in their neighborhood. In case of ties,
    a random label is chosen from the most frequent labels.

    The algorithm maintains a queue of nodes that still need to be processed.
    Initially, all nodes are added to the queue in a random order. Then the nodes
    are removed from the queue one by one and processed. If a node updates its label,
    all its neighbors that have a different label are added to the queue (if not
    already in the queue). The algorithm stops when the queue is empty.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : Graph, DiGraph, MultiGraph, or MultiDiGraph
      Any NetworkX graph.

    weight : string, or None (default)
      The edge attribute representing a non-negative weight of an edge. If None,
      each edge is assumed to have weight one. The weight of an edge is used in
      determining the frequency with which a label appears among the neighbors of
      a node (edge with weight `w` is equivalent to `w` unweighted edges).

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
      Indicator of random number generation state. See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    communities : iterable
      Iterable of communities given as sets of nodes.

    Notes
    -----
    Edge directions are ignored for directed graphs.
    Edge weights must be non-negative numbers.

def asyn_lpa_communities(G, weight: Incomplete | None = None, seed: Incomplete | None = None) -> Generator[Incomplete, Incomplete, None]:
    '''Returns communities in `G` as detected by asynchronous label
    propagation.

    The asynchronous label propagation algorithm is described in
    [1]_. The algorithm is probabilistic and the found communities may
    vary on different executions.

    The algorithm proceeds as follows. After initializing each node with
    a unique label, the algorithm repeatedly sets the label of a node to
    be the label that appears most frequently among that nodes
    neighbors. The algorithm halts when each node has the label that
    appears most frequently among its neighbors. The algorithm is
    asynchronous because each node is updated without waiting for
    updates on the remaining nodes.

    This generalized version of the algorithm in [1]_ accepts edge
    weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : Graph

    weight : string
        The edge attribute representing the weight of an edge.
        If None, each edge is assumed to have weight one. In this
        algorithm, the weight of an edge is used in determining the
        frequency with which a label appears among the neighbors of a
        node: a higher weight means the label appears more often.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    communities : iterable
        Iterable of communities given as sets of nodes.

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
