    The heuristic chooses the nodes according to their degree, i.e., first
    the node with the lowest degree is chosen, then the graph is updated
    and the corresponding node is removed. Next, a new node with the lowest
    degree is chosen, and so on.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    Returns
    -------
    Treewidth decomposition : (int, Graph) tuple
          2-tuple with treewidth and the corresponding decomposed tree.

    The heuristic chooses a node from the graph, where the number of edges

    small as possible.

    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
