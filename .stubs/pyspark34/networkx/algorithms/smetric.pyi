def s_metric(G, **kwargs):
    """Returns the s-metric [1]_ of graph.

    The s-metric is defined as the sum of the products ``deg(u) * deg(v)``
    for every edge ``(u, v)`` in `G`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        The graph used to compute the s-metric.
    normalized : bool (optional)
        Normalize the value.

        .. deprecated:: 3.2

           The `normalized` keyword argument is deprecated and will be removed
           in the future

    Returns
    -------
    s : float
        The s-metric of the graph.
