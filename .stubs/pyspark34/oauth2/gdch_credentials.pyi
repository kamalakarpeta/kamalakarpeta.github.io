class ServiceAccountCredentials(credentials.Credentials):
    '''Credentials for GDCH (`Google Distributed Cloud Hosted`_) for service
    account users.

    .. _Google Distributed Cloud Hosted:
        https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/            announcing-google-distributed-cloud-edge-and-hosted

    To create a GDCH service account credential, first create a JSON file of
    the following format::

        {
            "type": "gdch_service_account",
            "format_version": "1",
            "project": "<project name>",
            "private_key_id": "<key id>",
            "private_key": "-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
<key bytes>
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
",
            "name": "<service identity name>",
            "ca_cert_path": "<CA cert path>",
            "token_uri": "https://service-identity.<Domain>/authenticate"
        }

    The "format_version" field stands for the format of the JSON file. For now
    it is always "1". The `private_key_id` and `private_key` is used for signing.
    The `ca_cert_path` is used for token server TLS certificate verification.

    After the JSON file is created, set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment
    variable to the JSON file path, then use the following code to create the
    credential::

        import google.auth

        credential, _ = google.auth.default()
        credential = credential.with_gdch_audience("<the audience>")

    We can also create the credential directly::

        from google.oauth import gdch_credentials

        credential = gdch_credentials.ServiceAccountCredentials.from_service_account_file("<the json file path>")
        credential = credential.with_gdch_audience("<the audience>")

    The token is obtained in the following way. This class first creates a
    self signed JWT. It uses the `name` value as the `iss` and `sub` claim, and
    the `token_uri` as the `aud` claim, and signs the JWT with the `private_key`.
    It then sends the JWT to the `token_uri` to exchange a final token for
    `audience`.
