    except for fit_iterative all methods are inherited from WLS.

    Notes
    -----
    GLSHet is considered to be experimental.

    `fit` is just standard WLS fit for fixed weights
    `fit_iterative` updates the estimate for weights, see its docstring

    The two alternative for handling heteroscedasticity in the data are to
    use heteroscedasticity robust standard errors or estimating the
    heteroscedasticity
    Estimating heteroscedasticity and using weighted least squares produces
    smaller confidence intervals for the estimated parameters then the
    heteroscedasticity robust standard errors if the heteroscedasticity is
    correctly specified. If the heteroscedasticity is incorrectly specified
    then the estimated covariance is inconsistent.

    Stock and Watson for example argue in favor of using OLS with
    heteroscedasticity robust standard errors instead of GLSHet sind we are
    seldom sure enough about the correct specification (in economics).

    GLSHet has asymptotically the same distribution as WLS if the true
    weights are know. In both cases the asymptotic distribution of the
    parameter estimates is the normal distribution.

    The assumption of the model:

    y = X*beta + u,
    with E(u) = 0, E(X*u)=0, var(u_i) = z_i*gamma
    or for vector of all observations Sigma = diag(Z*gamma)

    where
    y : endog (nobs)
    X : exog  (nobs, k_vars)
    Z : exog_var (nobs, k_vars2)
    beta, gamma estimated parameters

    If a link is specified, then the heteroscedasticity is

    var(u_i) = link.inverse(z_i*gamma), or
    link(var(u_i)) = z_i*gamma

    for example for log-linkg
    var(u_i) = exp(z_i*gamma)
