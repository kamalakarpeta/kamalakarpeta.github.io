def bootstrap(*args, **kwargs):
    '''Resample one or more arrays with replacement and store aggregate values.

    Positional arguments are a sequence of arrays to bootstrap along the first
    axis and pass to a summary function.

    Keyword arguments:
        n_boot : int, default=10000
            Number of iterations
        axis : int, default=None
            Will pass axis to ``func`` as a keyword argument.
        units : array, default=None
            Array of sampling unit IDs. When used the bootstrap resamples units
            and then observations within units instead of individual
            datapoints.
        func : string or callable, default="mean"
            Function to call on the args that are passed in. If string, uses as
            name of function in the numpy namespace. If nans are present in the
            data, will try to use nan-aware version of named function.
        seed : Generator | SeedSequence | RandomState | int | None
            Seed for the random number generator; useful if you want
            reproducible resamples.

    Returns
    -------
    boot_dist: array
        array of bootstrapped statistic values
