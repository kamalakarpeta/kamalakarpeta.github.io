    Abstract object representing a handle to an open file (or folder) in an

    features of a file handle, like `stat` or `chattr`.

        ``readfile`` and/or ``writefile``, and if either or both are present,
        their ``close()`` methods are called.  This means that if you are

        Read up to ``length`` bytes from this file, starting at position

        to be 64 bits.

        If the end of the file has been reached, this method may return an
        empty string to signify EOF, or it may also return ``SFTP_EOF``.

        The default implementation checks for an attribute on ``self`` named
        ``readfile``, and if present, performs the read operation on the Python
        file-like object found there.  (This is meant as a time saver for the
        common case where you are wrapping a Python file object.)

        Write ``data`` into this file at position ``offset``.  Extending the
        file past its original end is expected.  Unlike Python's normal
        ``write()`` methods, this method cannot do a partial write: it must
        write all of ``data`` or else return an error.

        The default implementation checks for an attribute on ``self`` named
        ``writefile``, and if present, performs the write operation on the
        Python file-like object found there.  The attribute is named
        differently from ``readfile`` to make it easy to implement read-only
        (or write-only) files, but if both attributes are present, they should
        refer to the same file.
