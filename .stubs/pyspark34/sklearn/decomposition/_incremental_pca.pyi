class IncrementalPCA(_BasePCA):
    '''Incremental principal components analysis (IPCA).

    Linear dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition of
    the data, keeping only the most significant singular vectors to
    project the data to a lower dimensional space. The input data is centered
    but not scaled for each feature before applying the SVD.

    Depending on the size of the input data, this algorithm can be much more
    memory efficient than a PCA, and allows sparse input.

    This algorithm has constant memory complexity, on the order
    of ``batch_size * n_features``, enabling use of np.memmap files without
    loading the entire file into memory. For sparse matrices, the input
    is converted to dense in batches (in order to be able to subtract the
    mean) which avoids storing the entire dense matrix at any one time.

    The computational overhead of each SVD is
    ``O(batch_size * n_features ** 2)``, but only 2 * batch_size samples
    remain in memory at a time. There will be ``n_samples / batch_size`` SVD
    computations to get the principal components, versus 1 large SVD of
    complexity ``O(n_samples * n_features ** 2)`` for PCA.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_components : int, default=None
        Number of components to keep. If ``n_components`` is ``None``,
        then ``n_components`` is set to ``min(n_samples, n_features)``.

    whiten : bool, default=False
        When True (False by default) the ``components_`` vectors are divided
        by ``n_samples`` times ``components_`` to ensure uncorrelated outputs
        with unit component-wise variances.

        Whitening will remove some information from the transformed signal
        (the relative variance scales of the components) but can sometimes
        improve the predictive accuracy of the downstream estimators by
        making data respect some hard-wired assumptions.

    copy : bool, default=True
        If False, X will be overwritten. ``copy=False`` can be used to
        save memory but is unsafe for general use.

    batch_size : int, default=None
        The number of samples to use for each batch. Only used when calling
        ``fit``. If ``batch_size`` is ``None``, then ``batch_size``
        is inferred from the data and set to ``5 * n_features``, to provide a
        balance between approximation accuracy and memory consumption.

    Attributes
    ----------
    components_ : ndarray of shape (n_components, n_features)
        Principal axes in feature space, representing the directions of
        maximum variance in the data. Equivalently, the right singular
        vectors of the centered input data, parallel to its eigenvectors.
        The components are sorted by decreasing ``explained_variance_``.

    explained_variance_ : ndarray of shape (n_components,)
        Variance explained by each of the selected components.

    explained_variance_ratio_ : ndarray of shape (n_components,)
        Percentage of variance explained by each of the selected components.
        If all components are stored, the sum of explained variances is equal
        to 1.0.

    singular_values_ : ndarray of shape (n_components,)
        The singular values corresponding to each of the selected components.
        The singular values are equal to the 2-norms of the ``n_components``
        variables in the lower-dimensional space.

    mean_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        Per-feature empirical mean, aggregate over calls to ``partial_fit``.

    var_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        Per-feature empirical variance, aggregate over calls to
        ``partial_fit``.

    noise_variance_ : float
        The estimated noise covariance following the Probabilistic PCA model
        from Tipping and Bishop 1999. See "Pattern Recognition and
        Machine Learning" by C. Bishop, 12.2.1 p. 574 or
        http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-mppca.pdf.

    n_components_ : int
        The estimated number of components. Relevant when
        ``n_components=None``.

    n_samples_seen_ : int
        The number of samples processed by the estimator. Will be reset on
        new calls to fit, but increments across ``partial_fit`` calls.

    batch_size_ : int
        Inferred batch size from ``batch_size``.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

    See https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dross/ivt/RossLimLinYang_ijcv.pdf

    This model is an extension of the Sequential Karhunen-Loeve Transform from:
    :doi:`A. Levy and M. Lindenbaum, Sequential Karhunen-Loeve Basis Extraction and
    its Application to Images, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Volume 9,
    Number 8, pp. 1371-1374, August 2000. <10.1109/83.855432>`

    We have specifically abstained from an optimization used by authors of both
    papers, a QR decomposition used in specific situations to reduce the
    algorithmic complexity of the SVD. The source for this technique is
    *Matrix Computations, Third Edition, G. Holub and C. Van Loan, Chapter 5,
    section 5.4.4, pp 252-253.*. This technique has been omitted because it is
    advantageous only when decomposing a matrix with ``n_samples`` (rows)
    >= 5/3 * ``n_features`` (columns), and hurts the readability of the
    implemented algorithm. This would be a good opportunity for future
    optimization, if it is deemed necessary.
