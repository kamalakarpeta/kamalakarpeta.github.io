    Notes
    -----
    The implementation is designed to:

    * Mimic the behavior of StratifiedKFold as much as possible for trivial
      groups (e.g. when each group contains only one sample).
    * Be invariant to class label: relabelling ``y = ["Happy", "Sad"]`` to
      ``y = [1, 0]`` should not change the indices generated.
    * Stratify based on samples as much as possible while keeping
      non-overlapping groups constraint. That means that in some cases when
      there is a small number of groups containing a large number of samples
      the stratification will not be possible and the behavior will be close
      to GroupKFold.

class TimeSeriesSplit(_BaseKFold):
    '''Time Series cross-validator

    Provides train/test indices to split time series data samples
    that are observed at fixed time intervals, in train/test sets.
    In each split, test indices must be higher than before, and thus shuffling
    in cross validator is inappropriate.

    This cross-validation object is a variation of :class:`KFold`.
    In the kth split, it returns first k folds as train set and the
    (k+1)th fold as test set.

    Note that unlike standard cross-validation methods, successive
    training sets are supersets of those that come before them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=5
        Number of splits. Must be at least 2.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            ``n_splits`` default value changed from 3 to 5.

    max_train_size : int, default=None
        Maximum size for a single training set.

    test_size : int, default=None
        Used to limit the size of the test set. Defaults to
        ``n_samples // (n_splits + 1)``, which is the maximum allowed value
        with ``gap=0``.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    gap : int, default=0
        Number of samples to exclude from the end of each train set before

class GroupShuffleSplit(GroupsConsumerMixin, ShuffleSplit):
    '''Shuffle-Group(s)-Out cross-validation iterator

    Provides randomized train/test indices to split data according to a
    third-party provided group. This group information can be used to encode
    arbitrary domain specific stratifications of the samples as integers.

    For instance the groups could be the year of collection of the samples
    and thus allow for cross-validation against time-based splits.

    The difference between LeavePGroupsOut and GroupShuffleSplit is that
    the former generates splits using all subsets of size ``p`` unique groups,
    whereas GroupShuffleSplit generates a user-determined number of random
    test splits, each with a user-determined fraction of unique groups.

    For example, a less computationally intensive alternative to
    ``LeavePGroupsOut(p=10)`` would be
    ``GroupShuffleSplit(test_size=10, n_splits=100)``.

    Note: The parameters ``test_size`` and ``train_size`` refer to groups, and
    not to samples, as in ShuffleSplit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=5
        Number of re-shuffling & splitting iterations.

    test_size : float, int, default=0.2
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion
        of groups to include in the test split (rounded up). If int,
        represents the absolute number of test groups. If None, the value is
        set to the complement of the train size.
        The default will change in version 0.21. It will remain 0.2 only
        if ``train_size`` is unspecified, otherwise it will complement
        the specified ``train_size``.

    train_size : float or int, default=None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the groups to include in the train split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of train groups. If None,
        the value is automatically set to the complement of the test size.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the training and testing indices produced.

    ``next(ShuffleSplit().split(X, y))``, and application to input data
    into a single call for splitting (and optionally subsampling) data into a
    one-liner.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *arrays : sequence of indexables with same length / shape[0]
        Allowed inputs are lists, numpy arrays, scipy-sparse
        matrices or pandas dataframes.

    test_size : float or int, default=None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion
        of the dataset to include in the test split. If int, represents the
        absolute number of test samples. If None, the value is set to the
        complement of the train size. If ``train_size`` is also None, it will
        be set to 0.25.

    train_size : float or int, default=None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the dataset to include in the train split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of train samples. If None,
        the value is automatically set to the complement of the test size.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the shuffling applied to the data before applying the split.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    shuffle : bool, default=True
        Whether or not to shuffle the data before splitting. If shuffle=False
        then stratify must be None.

    stratify : array-like, default=None
        If not None, data is split in a stratified fashion, using this as
        the class labels.
        Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <stratification>`.

    Returns
    -------
    splitting : list, length=2 * len(arrays)
        List containing train-test split of inputs.

        .. versionadded:: 0.16
            If the input is sparse, the output will be a
            ``scipy.sparse.csr_matrix``. Else, output type is the same as the
            input type.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    >>> X, y = np.arange(10).reshape((5, 2)), range(5)
    >>> X
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3],
           [4, 5],
           [6, 7],
           [8, 9]])
    >>> list(y)
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

    >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    ...     X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)
    ...
    >>> X_train
    array([[4, 5],
           [0, 1],
           [6, 7]])
    >>> y_train
    [2, 0, 3]
    >>> X_test
    array([[2, 3],
           [8, 9]])
    >>> y_test
    [1, 4]

    >>> train_test_split(y, shuffle=False)
    [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4]]
