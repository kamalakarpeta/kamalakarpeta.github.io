    '''Meta-transformer for selecting features based on importance weights.

    .. versionadded:: 0.17

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <select_from_model>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object
        The base estimator from which the transformer is built.
        This can be both a fitted (if ``prefit`` is set to True)
        or a non-fitted estimator. The estimator should have a
        ``feature_importances_`` or ``coef_`` attribute after fitting.
        Otherwise, the ``importance_getter`` parameter should be used.

    threshold : str or float, default=None
        The threshold value to use for feature selection. Features whose
        absolute importance value is greater or equal are kept while the others
        are discarded. If "median" (resp. "mean"), then the ``threshold`` value
        is the median (resp. the mean) of the feature importances. A scaling
        factor (e.g., "1.25*mean") may also be used. If None and if the
        estimator has a parameter penalty set to l1, either explicitly
        or implicitly (e.g, Lasso), the threshold used is 1e-5.
        Otherwise, "mean" is used by default.

    prefit : bool, default=False
        Whether a prefit model is expected to be passed into the constructor
        directly or not.
        If `True`, `estimator` must be a fitted estimator.
        If `False`, `estimator` is fitted and updated by calling
        `fit` and `partial_fit`, respectively.

    norm_order : non-zero int, inf, -inf, default=1
        Order of the norm used to filter the vectors of coefficients below
        ``threshold`` in the case where the ``coef_`` attribute of the
        estimator is of dimension 2.

    max_features : int, callable, default=None
        The maximum number of features to select.

        - If an integer, then it specifies the maximum number of features to
          allow.
        - If a callable, then it specifies how to calculate the maximum number of
          features allowed by using the output of `max_features(X)`.
        - If `None`, then all features are kept.

        To only select based on ``max_features``, set ``threshold=-np.inf``.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
        .. versionchanged:: 1.1
           `max_features` accepts a callable.

    importance_getter : str or callable, default=\'auto\'
        If \'auto\', uses the feature importance either through a ``coef_``
        attribute or ``feature_importances_`` attribute of estimator.

        Also accepts a string that specifies an attribute name/path
        for extracting feature importance (implemented with `attrgetter`).
        For example, give `regressor_.coef_` in case of
        :class:`~sklearn.compose.TransformedTargetRegressor`  or
        `named_steps.clf.feature_importances_` in case of
        :class:`~sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` with its last step named `clf`.

        If `callable`, overrides the default feature importance getter.
        The callable is passed with the fitted estimator and it should
        return importance for each feature.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimator_ : estimator
        The base estimator from which the transformer is built. This attribute
        exist only when `fit` has been called.

        - If `prefit=True`, it is a deep copy of `estimator`.
        - If `prefit=False`, it is a clone of `estimator` and fit on the data
          passed to `fit` or `partial_fit`.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`. Only defined if the
        underlying estimator exposes such an attribute when fit.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    max_features_ : int
        Maximum number of features calculated during :term:`fit`. Only defined
        if the ``max_features`` is not `None`.

        - If `max_features` is an `int`, then `max_features_ = max_features`.
        - If `max_features` is a callable, then `max_features_ = max_features(X)`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    threshold_ : float
        The threshold value used for feature selection.

    Notes
    -----
    Allows NaN/Inf in the input if the underlying estimator does as well.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectFromModel
    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    >>> X = [[ 0.87, -1.34,  0.31 ],
    ...      [-2.79, -0.02, -0.85 ],
    ...      [-1.34, -0.48, -2.55 ],
    ...      [ 1.92,  1.48,  0.65 ]]
    >>> y = [0, 1, 0, 1]
    >>> selector = SelectFromModel(estimator=LogisticRegression()).fit(X, y)
    >>> selector.estimator_.coef_
    array([[-0.3252302 ,  0.83462377,  0.49750423]])
    >>> selector.threshold_
    0.55245...
    >>> selector.get_support()
    array([False,  True, False])
    >>> selector.transform(X)
    array([[-1.34],
           [-0.02],
           [-0.48],
           [ 1.48]])

    Using a callable to create a selector that can use no more than half
    of the input features.

    >>> def half_callable(X):
    ...     return round(len(X[0]) / 2)
    >>> half_selector = SelectFromModel(estimator=LogisticRegression(),
    ...                                 max_features=half_callable)
    >>> _ = half_selector.fit(X, y)
    >>> half_selector.max_features_
