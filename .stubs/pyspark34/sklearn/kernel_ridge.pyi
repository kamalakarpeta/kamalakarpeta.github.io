class KernelRidge(MultiOutputMixin, RegressorMixin, BaseEstimator):
    '''Kernel ridge regression.

    Kernel ridge regression (KRR) combines ridge regression (linear least
    squares with l2-norm regularization) with the kernel trick. It thus
    learns a linear function in the space induced by the respective kernel and
    the data. For non-linear kernels, this corresponds to a non-linear
    function in the original space.

    The form of the model learned by KRR is identical to support vector
    regression (SVR). However, different loss functions are used: KRR uses
    squared error loss while support vector regression uses epsilon-insensitive
    loss, both combined with l2 regularization. In contrast to SVR, fitting a
    KRR model can be done in closed-form and is typically faster for
    medium-sized datasets. On the other hand, the learned model is non-sparse
    and thus slower than SVR, which learns a sparse model for epsilon > 0, at
    prediction-time.

    This estimator has built-in support for multi-variate regression
    (i.e., when y is a 2d-array of shape [n_samples, n_targets]).

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <kernel_ridge>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float or array-like of shape (n_targets,), default=1.0
        Regularization strength; must be a positive float. Regularization
        improves the conditioning of the problem and reduces the variance of
        the estimates. Larger values specify stronger regularization.
        Alpha corresponds to ``1 / (2C)`` in other linear models such as
        :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` or
        :class:`~sklearn.svm.LinearSVC`. If an array is passed, penalties are
        assumed to be specific to the targets. Hence they must correspond in
        number. See :ref:`ridge_regression` for formula.

    kernel : str or callable, default="linear"
        Kernel mapping used internally. This parameter is directly passed to
        :class:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_kernel`.
        If `kernel` is a string, it must be one of the metrics
        in `pairwise.PAIRWISE_KERNEL_FUNCTIONS` or "precomputed".
        If `kernel` is "precomputed", X is assumed to be a kernel matrix.
        Alternatively, if `kernel` is a callable function, it is called on
        each pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The
        callable should take two rows from X as input and return the
        corresponding kernel value as a single number. This means that
        callables from :mod:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise` are not allowed, as
        they operate on matrices, not single samples. Use the string
        identifying the kernel instead.

    gamma : float, default=None
        Gamma parameter for the RBF, laplacian, polynomial, exponential chi2
        and sigmoid kernels. Interpretation of the default value is left to
        the kernel; see the documentation for sklearn.metrics.pairwise.
        Ignored by other kernels.

    degree : int, default=3
        Degree of the polynomial kernel. Ignored by other kernels.

    coef0 : float, default=1
        Zero coefficient for polynomial and sigmoid kernels.
        Ignored by other kernels.

    kernel_params : dict, default=None
        Additional parameters (keyword arguments) for kernel function passed
        as callable object.

    Attributes
    ----------
    dual_coef_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_targets)
        Representation of weight vector(s) in kernel space

    X_fit_ : {ndarray, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Training data, which is also required for prediction. If
        kernel == "precomputed" this is instead the precomputed
        training matrix, of shape (n_samples, n_samples).

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0
