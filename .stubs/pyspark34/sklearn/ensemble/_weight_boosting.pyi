class AdaBoostClassifier(ClassifierMixin, BaseWeightBoosting):
    '''An AdaBoost classifier.

    An AdaBoost [1] classifier is a meta-estimator that begins by fitting a
    classifier on the original dataset and then fits additional copies of the
    classifier on the same dataset but where the weights of incorrectly
    classified instances are adjusted such that subsequent classifiers focus
    more on difficult cases.

    This class implements the algorithm known as AdaBoost-SAMME [2].

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <adaboost>`.

    .. versionadded:: 0.14

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object, default=None
        The base estimator from which the boosted ensemble is built.
        Support for sample weighting is required, as well as proper
        ``classes_`` and ``n_classes_`` attributes. If ``None``, then
        the base estimator is :class:`~sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`
        initialized with `max_depth=1`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2
           `base_estimator` was renamed to `estimator`.

    n_estimators : int, default=50
        The maximum number of estimators at which boosting is terminated.
        In case of perfect fit, the learning procedure is stopped early.
        Values must be in the range `[1, inf)`.

    learning_rate : float, default=1.0
        Weight applied to each classifier at each boosting iteration. A higher
        learning rate increases the contribution of each classifier. There is
        a trade-off between the `learning_rate` and `n_estimators` parameters.
        Values must be in the range `(0.0, inf)`.

    algorithm : {\'SAMME\', \'SAMME.R\'}, default=\'SAMME.R\'
        If \'SAMME.R\' then use the SAMME.R real boosting algorithm.
        ``estimator`` must support calculation of class probabilities.
        If \'SAMME\' then use the SAMME discrete boosting algorithm.
        The SAMME.R algorithm typically converges faster than SAMME,
        achieving a lower test error with fewer boosting iterations.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the random seed given at each `estimator` at each
        boosting iteration.
        Thus, it is only used when `estimator` exposes a `random_state`.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    base_estimator : object, default=None
        The base estimator from which the boosted ensemble is built.
        Support for sample weighting is required, as well as proper
        ``classes_`` and ``n_classes_`` attributes. If ``None``, then
        the base estimator is :class:`~sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`

    estimators_ : list of classifiers
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    classes_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
        The classes labels.

    n_classes_ : int
        The number of classes.

    estimator_weights_ : ndarray of floats
        Weights for each estimator in the boosted ensemble.

    estimator_errors_ : ndarray of floats
        Classification error for each estimator in the boosted
        ensemble.

    feature_importances_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        The impurity-based feature importances if supported by the
        ``estimator`` (when based on decision trees).

        Warning: impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for
        high cardinality features (many unique values). See
