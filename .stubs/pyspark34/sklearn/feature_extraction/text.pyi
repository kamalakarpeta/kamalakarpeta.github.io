class HashingVectorizer(TransformerMixin, _VectorizerMixin, BaseEstimator, auto_wrap_output_keys=None):
    '''Convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token occurrences.

    It turns a collection of text documents into a scipy.sparse matrix holding
    token occurrence counts (or binary occurrence information), possibly
    normalized as token frequencies if norm=\'l1\' or projected on the euclidean
    unit sphere if norm=\'l2\'.

    This text vectorizer implementation uses the hashing trick to find the
    token string name to feature integer index mapping.

    This strategy has several advantages:

    - it is very low memory scalable to large datasets as there is no need to
      store a vocabulary dictionary in memory.

    - it is fast to pickle and un-pickle as it holds no state besides the
      constructor parameters.

    - it can be used in a streaming (partial fit) or parallel pipeline as there
      is no state computed during fit.

    There are also a couple of cons (vs using a CountVectorizer with an
    in-memory vocabulary):

    - there is no way to compute the inverse transform (from feature indices to
      string feature names) which can be a problem when trying to introspect
      which features are most important to a model.

    - there can be collisions: distinct tokens can be mapped to the same
      feature index. However in practice this is rarely an issue if n_features
      is large enough (e.g. 2 ** 18 for text classification problems).

    - no IDF weighting as this would render the transformer stateful.

    The hash function employed is the signed 32-bit version of Murmurhash3.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <text_feature_extraction>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input : {\'filename\', \'file\', \'content\'}, default=\'content\'
        - If `\'filename\'`, the sequence passed as an argument to fit is
          expected to be a list of filenames that need reading to fetch
          the raw content to analyze.

        - If `\'file\'`, the sequence items must have a \'read\' method (file-like
          object) that is called to fetch the bytes in memory.

        - If `\'content\'`, the input is expected to be a sequence of items that
          can be of type string or byte.

    encoding : str, default=\'utf-8\'
        If bytes or files are given to analyze, this encoding is used to
        decode.

    decode_error : {\'strict\', \'ignore\', \'replace\'}, default=\'strict\'
        Instruction on what to do if a byte sequence is given to analyze that
        contains characters not of the given `encoding`. By default, it is
        \'strict\', meaning that a UnicodeDecodeError will be raised. Other
        values are \'ignore\' and \'replace\'.

    strip_accents : {\'ascii\', \'unicode\'} or callable, default=None
        Remove accents and perform other character normalization
        during the preprocessing step.
        \'ascii\' is a fast method that only works on characters that have
        a direct ASCII mapping.
        \'unicode\' is a slightly slower method that works on any character.
        None (default) does nothing.

        Both \'ascii\' and \'unicode\' use NFKD normalization from
        :func:`unicodedata.normalize`.

    lowercase : bool, default=True
        Convert all characters to lowercase before tokenizing.

    preprocessor : callable, default=None
        Override the preprocessing (string transformation) stage while
        preserving the tokenizing and n-grams generation steps.
        Only applies if ``analyzer`` is not callable.

    tokenizer : callable, default=None
        Override the string tokenization step while preserving the
        preprocessing and n-grams generation steps.
        Only applies if ``analyzer == \'word\'``.

    stop_words : {\'english\'}, list, default=None
        If \'english\', a built-in stop word list for English is used.
        There are several known issues with \'english\' and you should
        consider an alternative (see :ref:`stop_words`).

        If a list, that list is assumed to contain stop words, all of which
        will be removed from the resulting tokens.
        Only applies if ``analyzer == \'word\'``.

    token_pattern : str or None, default=r"(?u)\\\\b\\\\w\\\\w+\\\\b"
        Regular expression denoting what constitutes a "token", only used
        if ``analyzer == \'word\'``. The default regexp selects tokens of 2
        or more alphanumeric characters (punctuation is completely ignored
        and always treated as a token separator).

        If there is a capturing group in token_pattern then the
        captured group content, not the entire match, becomes the token.
        At most one capturing group is permitted.

    ngram_range : tuple (min_n, max_n), default=(1, 1)
        The lower and upper boundary of the range of n-values for different
        n-grams to be extracted. All values of n such that min_n <= n <= max_n
        will be used. For example an ``ngram_range`` of ``(1, 1)`` means only
        unigrams, ``(1, 2)`` means unigrams and bigrams, and ``(2, 2)`` means
        only bigrams.
        Only applies if ``analyzer`` is not callable.

    analyzer : {\'word\', \'char\', \'char_wb\'} or callable, default=\'word\'
        Whether the feature should be made of word or character n-grams.
        Option \'char_wb\' creates character n-grams only from text inside
        word boundaries; n-grams at the edges of words are padded with space.

        If a callable is passed it is used to extract the sequence of features
        out of the raw, unprocessed input.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.21
            Since v0.21, if ``input`` is ``\'filename\'`` or ``\'file\'``, the data
            is first read from the file and then passed to the given callable
            analyzer.

    n_features : int, default=(2 ** 20)
        The number of features (columns) in the output matrices. Small numbers
        of features are likely to cause hash collisions, but large numbers
        will cause larger coefficient dimensions in linear learners.

    binary : bool, default=False
        If True, all non zero counts are set to 1. This is useful for discrete
        probabilistic models that model binary events rather than integer
        counts.

    norm : {\'l1\', \'l2\'}, default=\'l2\'
        Norm used to normalize term vectors. None for no normalization.

    alternate_sign : bool, default=True
        When True, an alternating sign is added to the features as to
        approximately conserve the inner product in the hashed space even for
        small n_features. This approach is similar to sparse random projection.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    dtype : type, default=np.float64
        Type of the matrix returned by fit_transform() or transform().

    vocabulary : Mapping or iterable, default=None
        Either a Mapping (e.g., a dict) where keys are terms and values are

        If True, all non zero counts are set to 1. This is useful for discrete
        probabilistic models that model binary events rather than integer
        counts.

    dtype : dtype, default=np.int64
        Type of the matrix returned by fit_transform() or transform().

    Attributes
    ----------
    vocabulary_ : dict
        A mapping of terms to feature indices.

    fixed_vocabulary_ : bool
        True if a fixed vocabulary of term to indices mapping
        is provided by the user.

    stop_words_ : set
        Terms that were ignored because they either:

          - occurred in too many documents (`max_df`)
          - occurred in too few documents (`min_df`)
          - were cut off by feature selection (`max_features`).

        This is only available if no vocabulary was given.

class TfidfTransformer(OneToOneFeatureMixin, TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator, auto_wrap_output_keys=None):
    '''Transform a count matrix to a normalized tf or tf-idf representation.

    Tf means term-frequency while tf-idf means term-frequency times inverse
    document-frequency. This is a common term weighting scheme in information
    retrieval, that has also found good use in document classification.

    The goal of using tf-idf instead of the raw frequencies of occurrence of a
    token in a given document is to scale down the impact of tokens that occur
    very frequently in a given corpus and that are hence empirically less
    informative than features that occur in a small fraction of the training
    corpus.

    The formula that is used to compute the tf-idf for a term t of a document d
    in a document set is tf-idf(t, d) = tf(t, d) * idf(t), and the idf is
    computed as idf(t) = log [ n / df(t) ] + 1 (if ``smooth_idf=False``), where
    n is the total number of documents in the document set and df(t) is the
    document frequency of t; the document frequency is the number of documents
    in the document set that contain the term t. The effect of adding "1" to
    the idf in the equation above is that terms with zero idf, i.e., terms
    that occur in all documents in a training set, will not be entirely
    ignored.
    (Note that the idf formula above differs from the standard textbook
    notation that defines the idf as
    idf(t) = log [ n / (df(t) + 1) ]).

    If ``smooth_idf=True`` (the default), the constant "1" is added to the
    numerator and denominator of the idf as if an extra document was seen
    containing every term in the collection exactly once, which prevents
    zero divisions: idf(t) = log [ (1 + n) / (1 + df(t)) ] + 1.

    Furthermore, the formulas used to compute tf and idf depend
    on parameter settings that correspond to the SMART notation used in IR
    as follows:

    Tf is "n" (natural) by default, "l" (logarithmic) when
    ``sublinear_tf=True``.
    Idf is "t" when use_idf is given, "n" (none) otherwise.
    Normalization is "c" (cosine) when ``norm=\'l2\'``, "n" (none)
    when ``norm=None``.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <text_feature_extraction>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    norm : {\'l1\', \'l2\'} or None, default=\'l2\'
        Each output row will have unit norm, either:

        - \'l2\': Sum of squares of vector elements is 1. The cosine
          similarity between two vectors is their dot product when l2 norm has
          been applied.
        - \'l1\': Sum of absolute values of vector elements is 1.
          See :func:`preprocessing.normalize`.
        - None: No normalization.

    use_idf : bool, default=True
        Enable inverse-document-frequency reweighting. If False, idf(t) = 1.

    smooth_idf : bool, default=True
        Smooth idf weights by adding one to document frequencies, as if an
        extra document was seen containing every term in the collection
        exactly once. Prevents zero divisions.

    sublinear_tf : bool, default=False
        Apply sublinear tf scaling, i.e. replace tf with 1 + log(tf).

    Attributes
    ----------
    idf_ : array of shape (n_features)
        The inverse document frequency (IDF) vector; only defined
        if  ``use_idf`` is True.

    Equivalent to :class:`CountVectorizer` followed by
    :class:`TfidfTransformer`.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <text_feature_extraction>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input : {\'filename\', \'file\', \'content\'}, default=\'content\'
        - If `\'filename\'`, the sequence passed as an argument to fit is
          expected to be a list of filenames that need reading to fetch
          the raw content to analyze.

        - If `\'file\'`, the sequence items must have a \'read\' method (file-like
          object) that is called to fetch the bytes in memory.

        - If `\'content\'`, the input is expected to be a sequence of items that
          can be of type string or byte.

    encoding : str, default=\'utf-8\'
        If bytes or files are given to analyze, this encoding is used to
        decode.

    decode_error : {\'strict\', \'ignore\', \'replace\'}, default=\'strict\'
        Instruction on what to do if a byte sequence is given to analyze that
        contains characters not of the given `encoding`. By default, it is
        \'strict\', meaning that a UnicodeDecodeError will be raised. Other
        values are \'ignore\' and \'replace\'.

    strip_accents : {\'ascii\', \'unicode\'} or callable, default=None
        Remove accents and perform other character normalization
        during the preprocessing step.
        \'ascii\' is a fast method that only works on characters that have
        a direct ASCII mapping.
        \'unicode\' is a slightly slower method that works on any characters.
        None (default) does nothing.

        Both \'ascii\' and \'unicode\' use NFKD normalization from
        :func:`unicodedata.normalize`.

    lowercase : bool, default=True
        Convert all characters to lowercase before tokenizing.

    preprocessor : callable, default=None
        Override the preprocessing (string transformation) stage while
        preserving the tokenizing and n-grams generation steps.
        Only applies if ``analyzer`` is not callable.

    tokenizer : callable, default=None
        Override the string tokenization step while preserving the
        preprocessing and n-grams generation steps.
        Only applies if ``analyzer == \'word\'``.

    analyzer : {\'word\', \'char\', \'char_wb\'} or callable, default=\'word\'
        Whether the feature should be made of word or character n-grams.
        Option \'char_wb\' creates character n-grams only from text inside
        word boundaries; n-grams at the edges of words are padded with space.

        If a callable is passed it is used to extract the sequence of features
        out of the raw, unprocessed input.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.21
            Since v0.21, if ``input`` is ``\'filename\'`` or ``\'file\'``, the data
            is first read from the file and then passed to the given callable
            analyzer.

    stop_words : {\'english\'}, list, default=None
        If a string, it is passed to _check_stop_list and the appropriate stop
        list is returned. \'english\' is currently the only supported string
        value.
        There are several known issues with \'english\' and you should
        consider an alternative (see :ref:`stop_words`).

        If a list, that list is assumed to contain stop words, all of which
        will be removed from the resulting tokens.
        Only applies if ``analyzer == \'word\'``.

        If None, no stop words will be used. In this case, setting `max_df`
        to a higher value, such as in the range (0.7, 1.0), can automatically detect
        and filter stop words based on intra corpus document frequency of terms.

    token_pattern : str, default=r"(?u)\\\\b\\\\w\\\\w+\\\\b"
        Regular expression denoting what constitutes a "token", only used
        if ``analyzer == \'word\'``. The default regexp selects tokens of 2
        or more alphanumeric characters (punctuation is completely ignored
        and always treated as a token separator).

        If there is a capturing group in token_pattern then the
        captured group content, not the entire match, becomes the token.
        At most one capturing group is permitted.

    ngram_range : tuple (min_n, max_n), default=(1, 1)
        The lower and upper boundary of the range of n-values for different
        n-grams to be extracted. All values of n such that min_n <= n <= max_n
        will be used. For example an ``ngram_range`` of ``(1, 1)`` means only
        unigrams, ``(1, 2)`` means unigrams and bigrams, and ``(2, 2)`` means
        only bigrams.
        Only applies if ``analyzer`` is not callable.

    max_df : float or int, default=1.0
        When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document
        frequency strictly higher than the given threshold (corpus-specific
        stop words).
        If float in range [0.0, 1.0], the parameter represents a proportion of
        documents, integer absolute counts.
        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.

    min_df : float or int, default=1
        When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document
        frequency strictly lower than the given threshold. This value is also
        called cut-off in the literature.
        If float in range of [0.0, 1.0], the parameter represents a proportion
        of documents, integer absolute counts.
        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.

    max_features : int, default=None
        If not None, build a vocabulary that only consider the top
        `max_features` ordered by term frequency across the corpus.
        Otherwise, all features are used.

        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.

    vocabulary : Mapping or iterable, default=None
        Either a Mapping (e.g., a dict) where keys are terms and values are
        indices in the feature matrix, or an iterable over terms. If not
        given, a vocabulary is determined from the input documents.

    binary : bool, default=False
        If True, all non-zero term counts are set to 1. This does not mean
        outputs will have only 0/1 values, only that the tf term in tf-idf
        is binary. (Set idf and normalization to False to get 0/1 outputs).

    dtype : dtype, default=float64
        Type of the matrix returned by fit_transform() or transform().

    norm : {\'l1\', \'l2\'} or None, default=\'l2\'
        Each output row will have unit norm, either:

        - \'l2\': Sum of squares of vector elements is 1. The cosine
          similarity between two vectors is their dot product when l2 norm has
          been applied.
        - \'l1\': Sum of absolute values of vector elements is 1.
          See :func:`preprocessing.normalize`.
        - None: No normalization.

    use_idf : bool, default=True
        Enable inverse-document-frequency reweighting. If False, idf(t) = 1.

    smooth_idf : bool, default=True
        Smooth idf weights by adding one to document frequencies, as if an
        extra document was seen containing every term in the collection
        exactly once. Prevents zero divisions.

    sublinear_tf : bool, default=False
        Apply sublinear tf scaling, i.e. replace tf with 1 + log(tf).

    Attributes
    ----------
    vocabulary_ : dict
        A mapping of terms to feature indices.

    fixed_vocabulary_ : bool
        True if a fixed vocabulary of term to indices mapping
        is provided by the user.

    idf_ : array of shape (n_features,)
        The inverse document frequency (IDF) vector; only defined
        if ``use_idf`` is True.

    stop_words_ : set
        Terms that were ignored because they either:

          - occurred in too many documents (`max_df`)
          - occurred in too few documents (`min_df`)
          - were cut off by feature selection (`max_features`).

        This is only available if no vocabulary was given.

        implemented.

        Parameters
        ----------
        raw_documents : iterable
            An iterable which generates either str, unicode or file objects.

        y : None
            This parameter is ignored.

        Returns
        -------
        X : sparse matrix of (n_samples, n_features)
            Tf-idf-weighted document-term matrix.
