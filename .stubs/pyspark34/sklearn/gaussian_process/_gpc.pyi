class _BinaryGaussianProcessClassifierLaplace(BaseEstimator):
    '''Binary Gaussian process classification based on Laplace approximation.

    The implementation is based on Algorithm 3.1, 3.2, and 5.1 from [RW2006]_.

    Internally, the Laplace approximation is used for approximating the
    non-Gaussian posterior by a Gaussian.

    Currently, the implementation is restricted to using the logistic link
    function.

    .. versionadded:: 0.18

    Parameters
    ----------
    kernel : kernel instance, default=None
        The kernel specifying the covariance function of the GP. If None is
        passed, the kernel "1.0 * RBF(1.0)" is used as default. Note that
        the kernel\'s hyperparameters are optimized during fitting.

    optimizer : \'fmin_l_bfgs_b\' or callable, default=\'fmin_l_bfgs_b\'
        Can either be one of the internally supported optimizers for optimizing
        the kernel\'s parameters, specified by a string, or an externally
        defined optimizer passed as a callable. If a callable is passed, it
        must have the  signature::

            def optimizer(obj_func, initial_theta, bounds):
                # * \'obj_func\' is the objective function to be maximized, which
                #   takes the hyperparameters theta as parameter and an
                #   optional flag eval_gradient, which determines if the
                #   gradient is returned additionally to the function value
                # * \'initial_theta\': the initial value for theta, which can be
                #   used by local optimizers
                # * \'bounds\': the bounds on the values of theta
                ....
                # Returned are the best found hyperparameters theta and
                # the corresponding value of the target function.
                return theta_opt, func_min

        Per default, the \'L-BFGS-B\' algorithm from scipy.optimize.minimize
        is used. If None is passed, the kernel\'s parameters are kept fixed.
        Available internal optimizers are::

            \'fmin_l_bfgs_b\'

    n_restarts_optimizer : int, default=0
        The number of restarts of the optimizer for finding the kernel\'s
        parameters which maximize the log-marginal likelihood. The first run
        of the optimizer is performed from the kernel\'s initial parameters,
        the remaining ones (if any) from thetas sampled log-uniform randomly
        from the space of allowed theta-values. If greater than 0, all bounds
        must be finite. Note that n_restarts_optimizer=0 implies that one
        run is performed.

    max_iter_predict : int, default=100
        The maximum number of iterations in Newton\'s method for approximating
        the posterior during predict. Smaller values will reduce computation
        time at the cost of worse results.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        If warm-starts are enabled, the solution of the last Newton iteration
        on the Laplace approximation of the posterior mode is used as
        initialization for the next call of _posterior_mode(). This can speed
        up convergence when _posterior_mode is called several times on similar
        problems as in hyperparameter optimization. See :term:`the Glossary
        <warm_start>`.

    copy_X_train : bool, default=True
        If True, a persistent copy of the training data is stored in the
        object. Otherwise, just a reference to the training data is stored,
        which might cause predictions to change if the data is modified
        externally.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation used to initialize the centers.
        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    X_train_ : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features) or list of object
        Feature vectors or other representations of training data (also
        required for prediction).

    y_train_ : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Target values in training data (also required for prediction)

    classes_ : array-like of shape (n_classes,)
        Unique class labels.

    kernel_ : kernl instance
        The kernel used for prediction. The structure of the kernel is the
        same as the one passed as parameter but with optimized hyperparameters

    L_ : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        Lower-triangular Cholesky decomposition of the kernel in X_train_

    pi_ : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        The probabilities of the positive class for the training points
        X_train_

    W_sr_ : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Square root of W, the Hessian of log-likelihood of the latent function
        values for the observed labels. Since W is diagonal, only the diagonal
        of sqrt(W) is stored.

    log_marginal_likelihood_value_ : float
        The log-marginal-likelihood of ``self.kernel_.theta``

    .. versionadded:: 0.18

    Parameters
    ----------
    kernel : kernel instance, default=None
        The kernel specifying the covariance function of the GP. If None is
        passed, the kernel "1.0 * RBF(1.0)" is used as default. Note that
        the kernel\'s hyperparameters are optimized during fitting. Also kernel
        cannot be a `CompoundKernel`.

    optimizer : \'fmin_l_bfgs_b\', callable or None, default=\'fmin_l_bfgs_b\'
        Can either be one of the internally supported optimizers for optimizing
        the kernel\'s parameters, specified by a string, or an externally
        defined optimizer passed as a callable. If a callable is passed, it
        must have the  signature::

            def optimizer(obj_func, initial_theta, bounds):
                # * \'obj_func\' is the objective function to be maximized, which
                #   takes the hyperparameters theta as parameter and an
                #   optional flag eval_gradient, which determines if the
                #   gradient is returned additionally to the function value
                # * \'initial_theta\': the initial value for theta, which can be
                #   used by local optimizers
                # * \'bounds\': the bounds on the values of theta
                ....
                # Returned are the best found hyperparameters theta and
                # the corresponding value of the target function.
                return theta_opt, func_min

        Per default, the \'L-BFGS-B\' algorithm from scipy.optimize.minimize
        is used. If None is passed, the kernel\'s parameters are kept fixed.
        Available internal optimizers are::

            \'fmin_l_bfgs_b\'

    n_restarts_optimizer : int, default=0
        The number of restarts of the optimizer for finding the kernel\'s
        parameters which maximize the log-marginal likelihood. The first run
        of the optimizer is performed from the kernel\'s initial parameters,
        the remaining ones (if any) from thetas sampled log-uniform randomly
        from the space of allowed theta-values. If greater than 0, all bounds
        must be finite. Note that n_restarts_optimizer=0 implies that one
        run is performed.

    max_iter_predict : int, default=100
        The maximum number of iterations in Newton\'s method for approximating
        the posterior during predict. Smaller values will reduce computation
        time at the cost of worse results.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        If warm-starts are enabled, the solution of the last Newton iteration
        on the Laplace approximation of the posterior mode is used as
        initialization for the next call of _posterior_mode(). This can speed
        up convergence when _posterior_mode is called several times on similar
        problems as in hyperparameter optimization. See :term:`the Glossary
        <warm_start>`.

    copy_X_train : bool, default=True
        If True, a persistent copy of the training data is stored in the
        object. Otherwise, just a reference to the training data is stored,
        which might cause predictions to change if the data is modified
        externally.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation used to initialize the centers.
        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    multi_class : {\'one_vs_rest\', \'one_vs_one\'}, default=\'one_vs_rest\'
        Specifies how multi-class classification problems are handled.
        Supported are \'one_vs_rest\' and \'one_vs_one\'. In \'one_vs_rest\',
        one binary Gaussian process classifier is fitted for each class, which
        is trained to separate this class from the rest. In \'one_vs_one\', one
        binary Gaussian process classifier is fitted for each pair of classes,
        which is trained to separate these two classes. The predictions of
        these binary predictors are combined into multi-class predictions.
        Note that \'one_vs_one\' does not support predicting probability
        estimates.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to use for the computation: the specified
        multiclass problems are computed in parallel.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    base_estimator_ : ``Estimator`` instance
        The estimator instance that defines the likelihood function
        using the observed data.

    kernel_ : kernel instance
        The kernel used for prediction. In case of binary classification,
        the structure of the kernel is the same as the one passed as parameter
        but with optimized hyperparameters. In case of multi-class
        classification, a CompoundKernel is returned which consists of the
        different kernels used in the one-versus-rest classifiers.

    log_marginal_likelihood_value_ : float
        The log-marginal-likelihood of ``self.kernel_.theta``

    classes_ : array-like of shape (n_classes,)
        Unique class labels.

    n_classes_ : int
        The number of classes in the training data

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.
