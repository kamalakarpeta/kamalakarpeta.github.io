    '''Compute the mean Silhouette Coefficient of all samples.

    The Silhouette Coefficient is calculated using the mean intra-cluster
    distance (``a``) and the mean nearest-cluster distance (``b``) for each
    sample.  The Silhouette Coefficient for a sample is ``(b - a) / max(a,
    b)``.  To clarify, ``b`` is the distance between a sample and the nearest
    cluster that the sample is not a part of.
    Note that Silhouette Coefficient is only defined if number of labels
    is ``2 <= n_labels <= n_samples - 1``.

    This function returns the mean Silhouette Coefficient over all samples.
    To obtain the values for each sample, use :func:`silhouette_samples`.

    The best value is 1 and the worst value is -1. Values near 0 indicate
    overlapping clusters. Negative values generally indicate that a sample has
    been assigned to the wrong cluster, as a different cluster is more similar.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <silhouette_coefficient>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples_a, n_samples_a) if metric ==             "precomputed" or (n_samples_a, n_features) otherwise
        An array of pairwise distances between samples, or a feature array.

    labels : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Predicted labels for each sample.

    metric : str or callable, default=\'euclidean\'
        The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a
        feature array. If metric is a string, it must be one of the options
        allowed by :func:`metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances
        <sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances>`. If ``X`` is
        the distance array itself, use ``metric="precomputed"``.

    sample_size : int, default=None
        The size of the sample to use when computing the Silhouette Coefficient
        on a random subset of the data.
        If ``sample_size is None``, no sampling is used.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for selecting a subset of samples.
        Used when ``sample_size is not None``.
        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    **kwds : optional keyword parameters
        Any further parameters are passed directly to the distance function.
        If using a scipy.spatial.distance metric, the parameters are still
        metric dependent. See the scipy docs for usage examples.

    Returns
    -------
    silhouette : float
        Mean Silhouette Coefficient for all samples.

def silhouette_samples(X, labels, *, metric: str = 'euclidean', **kwds):
    '''Compute the Silhouette Coefficient for each sample.

    The Silhouette Coefficient is a measure of how well samples are clustered
    with samples that are similar to themselves. Clustering models with a high
    Silhouette Coefficient are said to be dense, where samples in the same
    cluster are similar to each other, and well separated, where samples in
    different clusters are not very similar to each other.

    The Silhouette Coefficient is calculated using the mean intra-cluster
    distance (``a``) and the mean nearest-cluster distance (``b``) for each
    sample.  The Silhouette Coefficient for a sample is ``(b - a) / max(a,
    b)``.
    Note that Silhouette Coefficient is only defined if number of labels
    is 2 ``<= n_labels <= n_samples - 1``.

    This function returns the Silhouette Coefficient for each sample.

    The best value is 1 and the worst value is -1. Values near 0 indicate
    overlapping clusters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples_a, n_samples_a) if metric ==             "precomputed" or (n_samples_a, n_features) otherwise
        An array of pairwise distances between samples, or a feature array. If
        a sparse matrix is provided, CSR format should be favoured avoiding
        an additional copy.

    labels : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Label values for each sample.

    metric : str or callable, default=\'euclidean\'
        The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a
        feature array. If metric is a string, it must be one of the options
        allowed by :func:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances`.
        If ``X`` is the distance array itself, use "precomputed" as the metric.
        Precomputed distance matrices must have 0 along the diagonal.

    **kwds : optional keyword parameters
        Any further parameters are passed directly to the distance function.
        If using a ``scipy.spatial.distance`` metric, the parameters are still
        metric dependent. See the scipy docs for usage examples.

    Returns
    -------
    silhouette : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Silhouette Coefficients for each sample.

    The score is defined as the average similarity measure of each cluster with

    apart and less dispersed will result in a better score.

    The minimum score is zero, with lower values indicating better clustering.
