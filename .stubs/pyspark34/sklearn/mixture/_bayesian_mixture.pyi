class BayesianGaussianMixture(BaseMixture):
    '''Variational Bayesian estimation of a Gaussian mixture.

    This class allows to infer an approximate posterior distribution over the
    parameters of a Gaussian mixture distribution. The effective number of
    components can be inferred from the data.

    This class implements two types of prior for the weights distribution: a
    finite mixture model with Dirichlet distribution and an infinite mixture
    model with the Dirichlet Process. In practice Dirichlet Process inference
    algorithm is approximated and uses a truncated distribution with a fixed
    maximum number of components (called the Stick-breaking representation).
    The number of components actually used almost always depends on the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_components : int, default=1
        The number of mixture components. Depending on the data and the value
        of the `weight_concentration_prior` the model can decide to not use
        all the components by setting some component `weights_` to values very
        close to zero. The number of effective components is therefore smaller
        than n_components.

    covariance_type : {\'full\', \'tied\', \'diag\', \'spherical\'}, default=\'full\'
        String describing the type of covariance parameters to use.
        Must be one of::

            \'full\' (each component has its own general covariance matrix),
            \'tied\' (all components share the same general covariance matrix),
            \'diag\' (each component has its own diagonal covariance matrix),
            \'spherical\' (each component has its own single variance).

    tol : float, default=1e-3
        The convergence threshold. EM iterations will stop when the
        lower bound average gain on the likelihood (of the training data with
        respect to the model) is below this threshold.

    reg_covar : float, default=1e-6
        Non-negative regularization added to the diagonal of covariance.
        Allows to assure that the covariance matrices are all positive.

    max_iter : int, default=100
        The number of EM iterations to perform.

    n_init : int, default=1
        The number of initializations to perform. The result with the highest
        lower bound value on the likelihood is kept.

    init_params : {\'kmeans\', \'k-means++\', \'random\', \'random_from_data\'},     default=\'kmeans\'
        The method used to initialize the weights, the means and the
        covariances.
        String must be one of:

            \'kmeans\' : responsibilities are initialized using kmeans.
            \'k-means++\' : use the k-means++ method to initialize.
            \'random\' : responsibilities are initialized randomly.
            \'random_from_data\' : initial means are randomly selected data points.

        .. versionchanged:: v1.1
            `init_params` now accepts \'random_from_data\' and \'k-means++\' as
            initialization methods.

    weight_concentration_prior_type : {\'dirichlet_process\', \'dirichlet_distribution\'},             default=\'dirichlet_process\'
        String describing the type of the weight concentration prior.

    weight_concentration_prior : float or None, default=None
        The dirichlet concentration of each component on the weight
        distribution (Dirichlet). This is commonly called gamma in the
        literature. The higher concentration puts more mass in
        the center and will lead to more components being active, while a lower
        concentration parameter will lead to more mass at the edge of the
        mixture weights simplex. The value of the parameter must be greater
        than 0. If it is None, it\'s set to ``1. / n_components``.

    mean_precision_prior : float or None, default=None
        The precision prior on the mean distribution (Gaussian).
        Controls the extent of where means can be placed. Larger
        values concentrate the cluster means around `mean_prior`.
        The value of the parameter must be greater than 0.
        If it is None, it is set to 1.

    mean_prior : array-like, shape (n_features,), default=None
        The prior on the mean distribution (Gaussian).
        If it is None, it is set to the mean of X.

    degrees_of_freedom_prior : float or None, default=None
        The prior of the number of degrees of freedom on the covariance
        distributions (Wishart). If it is None, it\'s set to `n_features`.

    covariance_prior : float or array-like, default=None
        The prior on the covariance distribution (Wishart).
        If it is None, the emiprical covariance prior is initialized using the
        covariance of X. The shape depends on `covariance_type`::

                (n_features, n_features) if \'full\',
                (n_features, n_features) if \'tied\',
                (n_features)             if \'diag\',
                float                    if \'spherical\'

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the random seed given to the method chosen to initialize the
        parameters (see `init_params`).
        In addition, it controls the generation of random samples from the
        fitted distribution (see the method `sample`).
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        If \'warm_start\' is True, the solution of the last fitting is used as
        initialization for the next call of fit(). This can speed up
        convergence when fit is called several times on similar problems.
        See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Enable verbose output. If 1 then it prints the current
        initialization and each iteration step. If greater than 1 then
        it prints also the log probability and the time needed
        for each step.

    verbose_interval : int, default=10
        Number of iteration done before the next print.

        The mean of each mixture component.

    covariances_ : array-like
        The covariance of each mixture component.
        The shape depends on `covariance_type`::

            (n_components,)                        if \'spherical\',
            (n_features, n_features)               if \'tied\',
            (n_components, n_features)             if \'diag\',

    precisions_ : array-like
        The precision matrices for each component in the mixture. A precision
        matrix is the inverse of a covariance matrix. A covariance matrix is
        symmetric positive definite so the mixture of Gaussian can be
        equivalently parameterized by the precision matrices. Storing the
        precision matrices instead of the covariance matrices makes it more
        efficient to compute the log-likelihood of new samples at test time.
        The shape depends on ``covariance_type``::

            (n_components,)                        if \'spherical\',
            (n_features, n_features)               if \'tied\',
            (n_components, n_features)             if \'diag\',
            (n_components, n_features, n_features) if \'full\'

    precisions_cholesky_ : array-like
        The cholesky decomposition of the precision matrices of each mixture
        component. A precision matrix is the inverse of a covariance matrix.

        Storing the precision matrices instead of the covariance matrices makes
        it more efficient to compute the log-likelihood of new samples at test
        time. The shape depends on ``covariance_type``::

            (n_components,)                        if \'spherical\',

        The dirichlet concentration of each component on the weight
        distribution (Dirichlet). The type depends on
        ``weight_concentration_prior_type``::

            (float, float) if \'dirichlet_process\' (Beta parameters),
            float          if \'dirichlet_distribution\' (Dirichlet parameters).

        The higher concentration puts more mass in
        the center and will lead to more components being active, while a lower
        concentration parameter will lead to more mass at the edge of the
        simplex.

    weight_concentration_ : array-like of shape (n_components,)
        The dirichlet concentration of each component on the weight
        distribution (Dirichlet).

    mean_precision_prior_ : float
        The precision prior on the mean distribution (Gaussian).
        Controls the extent of where means can be placed.
        Larger values concentrate the cluster means around `mean_prior`.
