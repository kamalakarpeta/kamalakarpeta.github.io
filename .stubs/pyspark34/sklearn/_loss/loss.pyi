class HalfMultinomialLoss(BaseLoss):
    '''Categorical cross-entropy loss, for multiclass classification.

    Domain:
    y_true in {0, 1, 2, 3, .., n_classes - 1}
    y_pred has n_classes elements, each element in (0, 1)

    Link:
    y_pred = softmax(raw_prediction)

    Note: We assume y_true to be already label encoded. The inverse link is
    softmax. But the full link function is the symmetric multinomial logit
    function.

    For a given sample x_i, the categorical cross-entropy loss is defined as
    the negative log-likelihood of the multinomial distribution, it
    generalizes the binary cross-entropy to more than 2 classes::

        loss_i = log(sum(exp(raw_pred_{i, k}), k=0..n_classes-1))
                - sum(y_true_{i, k} * raw_pred_{i, k}, k=0..n_classes-1)

    See [1].

    Note that for the hessian, we calculate only the diagonal part in the
    classes: If the full hessian for classes k and l and sample i is H_i_k_l,
    we calculate H_i_k_k, i.e. k=l.

    Note that the formulation works for classification, y = {0, 1}, as well as
    "exponential logistic" regression, y = [0, 1].
    Note that this is a proper scoring rule, but without it\'s canonical link.

    More details: Inserting the predicted probability
    y_pred = expit(2 * raw_prediction) in the loss gives::
