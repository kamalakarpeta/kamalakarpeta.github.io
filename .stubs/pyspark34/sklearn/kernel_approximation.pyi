class PolynomialCountSketch(ClassNamePrefixFeaturesOutMixin, TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):
    '''Polynomial kernel approximation via Tensor Sketch.

    Implements Tensor Sketch, which approximates the feature map
    of the polynomial kernel::

        K(X, Y) = (gamma * <X, Y> + coef0)^degree

    by efficiently computing a Count Sketch of the outer product of a
    vector with itself using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). Read more in the
    :ref:`User Guide <polynomial_kernel_approx>`.

    .. versionadded:: 0.24

    Parameters
    ----------
    gamma : float, default=1.0
        Parameter of the polynomial kernel whose feature map
        will be approximated.

    degree : int, default=2
        Degree of the polynomial kernel whose feature map
        will be approximated.

    coef0 : int, default=0
        Constant term of the polynomial kernel whose feature map
        will be approximated.

    n_components : int, default=100
        Dimensionality of the output feature space. Usually, `n_components`
        should be greater than the number of features in input samples in
        order to achieve good performance. The optimal score / run time
        balance is typically achieved around `n_components` = 10 * `n_features`,
        but this depends on the specific dataset being used.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        Determines random number generation for indexHash and bitHash
        initialization. Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple
        function calls. See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

        Array with random entries in {+1, -1}, used to represent
        the 2-wise independent hash functions for Count Sketch computation.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)

        has feature names that are all strings.

class AdditiveChi2Sampler(TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):
    '''Approximate feature map for additive chi2 kernel.

    Uses sampling the fourier transform of the kernel characteristic
    at regular intervals.

    Since the kernel that is to be approximated is additive, the components of
    the input vectors can be treated separately.  Each entry in the original
    space is transformed into 2*sample_steps-1 features, where sample_steps is
    a parameter of the method. Typical values of sample_steps include 1, 2 and
    3.

    Optimal choices for the sampling interval for certain data ranges can be
