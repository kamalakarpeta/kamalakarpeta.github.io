class KernelDensity(BaseEstimator):
    '''Kernel Density Estimation.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <kernel_density>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bandwidth : float or {"scott", "silverman"}, default=1.0
        The bandwidth of the kernel. If bandwidth is a float, it defines the
        bandwidth of the kernel. If bandwidth is a string, one of the estimation
        methods is implemented.

    algorithm : {\'kd_tree\', \'ball_tree\', \'auto\'}, default=\'auto\'
        The tree algorithm to use.

    kernel : {\'gaussian\', \'tophat\', \'epanechnikov\', \'exponential\', \'linear\',                  \'cosine\'}, default=\'gaussian\'
        The kernel to use.

    metric : str, default=\'euclidean\'
        Metric to use for distance computation. See the
        documentation of `scipy.spatial.distance
        <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.distance.html>`_ and
        the metrics listed in
        :class:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise.distance_metrics` for valid metric
        values.

        Not all metrics are valid with all algorithms: refer to the
        documentation of :class:`BallTree` and :class:`KDTree`. Note that the
        normalization of the density output is correct only for the Euclidean
        distance metric.

    atol : float, default=0
        The desired absolute tolerance of the result.  A larger tolerance will
        generally lead to faster execution.

    rtol : float, default=0
        The desired relative tolerance of the result.  A larger tolerance will
        generally lead to faster execution.

    breadth_first : bool, default=True
        If true (default), use a breadth-first approach to the problem.
        Otherwise use a depth-first approach.

    leaf_size : int, default=40
        Specify the leaf size of the underlying tree.  See :class:`BallTree`
        or :class:`KDTree` for details.

    metric_params : dict, default=None
        Additional parameters to be passed to the tree for use with the
        metric.  For more information, see the documentation of
        :class:`BallTree` or :class:`KDTree`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    tree_ : ``BinaryTree`` instance
        The tree algorithm for fast generalized N-point problems.

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

    bandwidth_ : float
        Value of the bandwidth, given directly by the bandwidth parameter or
        estimated using the \'scott\' or \'silverman\' method.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0
