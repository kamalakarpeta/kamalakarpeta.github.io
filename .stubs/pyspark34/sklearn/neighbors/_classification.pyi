class KNeighborsClassifier(KNeighborsMixin, ClassifierMixin, NeighborsBase):
    '''Classifier implementing the k-nearest neighbors vote.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <classification>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, default=5
        Number of neighbors to use by default for :meth:`kneighbors` queries.

    weights : {\'uniform\', \'distance\'}, callable or None, default=\'uniform\'
        Weight function used in prediction.  Possible values:

        - \'uniform\' : uniform weights.  All points in each neighborhood
          are weighted equally.
        - \'distance\' : weight points by the inverse of their distance.
          in this case, closer neighbors of a query point will have a
          greater influence than neighbors which are further away.
        - [callable] : a user-defined function which accepts an
          array of distances, and returns an array of the same shape
          containing the weights.

    algorithm : {\'auto\', \'ball_tree\', \'kd_tree\', \'brute\'}, default=\'auto\'
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

        - \'ball_tree\' will use :class:`BallTree`
        - \'kd_tree\' will use :class:`KDTree`
        - \'brute\' will use a brute-force search.
        - \'auto\' will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm
          based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.

        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of
        this parameter, using brute force.

    leaf_size : int, default=30
        Leaf size passed to BallTree or KDTree.  This can affect the
        speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree.  The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.

    p : int, default=2
        Power parameter for the Minkowski metric. When p = 1, this is
        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    metric : str or callable, default=\'minkowski\'
        Metric to use for distance computation. Default is "minkowski", which
        results in the standard Euclidean distance when p = 2. See the
        documentation of `scipy.spatial.distance
        <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.distance.html>`_ and
        the metrics listed in
        :class:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise.distance_metrics` for valid metric
        values.

        If metric is "precomputed", X is assumed to be a distance matrix and
        must be square during fit. X may be a :term:`sparse graph`, in which
        case only "nonzero" elements may be considered neighbors.

        If metric is a callable function, it takes two arrays representing 1D
        vectors as inputs and must return one value indicating the distance
        between those vectors. This works for Scipy\'s metrics, but is less
        efficient than passing the metric name as a string.

    metric_params : dict, default=None
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.
        Doesn\'t affect :meth:`fit` method.

    Attributes
    ----------
    classes_ : array of shape (n_classes,)
        Class labels known to the classifier

    effective_metric_ : str or callble
        The distance metric used. It will be same as the `metric` parameter
        or a synonym of it, e.g. \'euclidean\' if the `metric` parameter set to
        \'minkowski\' and `p` parameter set to 2.

    effective_metric_params_ : dict
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function. For most metrics
        will be same with `metric_params` parameter, but may also contain the
        `p` parameter value if the `effective_metric_` attribute is set to
        \'minkowski\'.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    n_samples_fit_ : int
        Number of samples in the fitted data.

    outputs_2d_ : bool
        False when `y`\'s shape is (n_samples, ) or (n_samples, 1) during fit
        otherwise True.

    .. warning::

       Regarding the Nearest Neighbors algorithms, if it is found that two
       neighbors, neighbor `k+1` and `k`, have identical distances
       but different labels, the results will depend on the ordering of the
       training data.
