    """Imputation for completing missing values using k-Nearest Neighbors.

    Each sample's missing values are imputed using the mean value from
    `n_neighbors` nearest neighbors found in the training set. Two samples are
    close if the features that neither is missing are close.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <knnimpute>`.

    .. versionadded:: 0.22

    Parameters
    ----------
    missing_values : int, float, str, np.nan or None, default=np.nan
        The placeholder for the missing values. All occurrences of
        `missing_values` will be imputed. For pandas' dataframes with
        nullable integer dtypes with missing values, `missing_values`
        should be set to np.nan, since `pd.NA` will be converted to np.nan.

    n_neighbors : int, default=5
        Number of neighboring samples to use for imputation.

    weights : {'uniform', 'distance'} or callable, default='uniform'
        Weight function used in prediction.  Possible values:

        - 'uniform' : uniform weights. All points in each neighborhood are
          weighted equally.
        - 'distance' : weight points by the inverse of their distance.
          in this case, closer neighbors of a query point will have a
          greater influence than neighbors which are further away.
        - callable : a user-defined function which accepts an
          array of distances, and returns an array of the same shape
          containing the weights.

    metric : {'nan_euclidean'} or callable, default='nan_euclidean'
        Distance metric for searching neighbors. Possible values:

        - 'nan_euclidean'
        - callable : a user-defined function which conforms to the definition
          of ``_pairwise_callable(X, Y, metric, **kwds)``. The function
          accepts two arrays, X and Y, and a `missing_values` keyword in
          `kwds` and returns a scalar distance value.

    copy : bool, default=True
        If True, a copy of X will be created. If False, imputation will
        be done in-place whenever possible.

    add_indicator : bool, default=False
        If True, a :class:`MissingIndicator` transform will stack onto the
        output of the imputer's transform. This allows a predictive estimator
        to account for missingness despite imputation. If a feature has no
        missing values at fit/train time, the feature won't appear on the
        missing indicator even if there are missing values at transform/test
        time.

    keep_empty_features : bool, default=False
        If True, features that consist exclusively of missing values when
        `fit` is called are returned in results when `transform` is called.
        The imputed value is always `0`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

    Attributes
    ----------
    indicator_ : :class:`~sklearn.impute.MissingIndicator`
        Indicator used to add binary indicators for missing values.
        ``None`` if add_indicator is False.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0
