    Parameters
    ----------
    data_home : str, default=None
        Specify another download and cache folder for the datasets. By default
        all scikit-learn data is stored in '~/scikit_learn_data' subfolders.

    funneled : bool, default=True
        Download and use the funneled variant of the dataset.

    resize : float or None, default=0.5
        Ratio used to resize the each face picture. If `None`, no resizing is
        performed.

    min_faces_per_person : int, default=None
        The extracted dataset will only retain pictures of people that have at
        least `min_faces_per_person` different pictures.

    color : bool, default=False
        Keep the 3 RGB channels instead of averaging them to a single
        gray level channel. If color is True the shape of the data has
        one more dimension than the shape with color = False.

    slice_ : tuple of slice, default=(slice(70, 195), slice(78, 172))
        Provide a custom 2D slice (height, width) to extract the
        'interesting' part of the jpeg files and avoid use statistical
        correlation from the background.

    download_if_missing : bool, default=True
        If False, raise an OSError if the data is not locally available
        instead of trying to download the data from the source site.

    return_X_y : bool, default=False
        If True, returns ``(dataset.data, dataset.target)`` instead of a Bunch
        object. See below for more information about the `dataset.data` and
        `dataset.target` object.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    Returns
    -------
    dataset : :class:`~sklearn.utils.Bunch`
        Dictionary-like object, with the following attributes.

        data : numpy array of shape (13233, 2914)
            Each row corresponds to a ravelled face image
            of original size 62 x 47 pixels.
            Changing the ``slice_`` or resize parameters will change the
            shape of the output.
        images : numpy array of shape (13233, 62, 47)
            Each row is a face image corresponding to one of the 5749 people in
            the dataset. Changing the ``slice_``
            or resize parameters will change the shape of the output.
        target : numpy array of shape (13233,)
            Labels associated to each face image.
            Those labels range from 0-5748 and correspond to the person IDs.
        target_names : numpy array of shape (5749,)
            Names of all persons in the dataset.
            Position in array corresponds to the person ID in the target array.
        DESCR : str
            Description of the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.

    (data, target) : tuple if ``return_X_y`` is True
        A tuple of two ndarray. The first containing a 2D array of
        shape (n_samples, n_features) with each row representing one
        sample and each column representing the features. The second
        ndarray of shape (n_samples,) containing the target samples.

    In the official `README.txt`_ this task is described as the
    "Restricted" task.  As I am not sure as to implement the
    "Unrestricted" variant correctly, I left it as unsupported for now.

      .. _`README.txt`: http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/README.txt

    The original images are 250 x 250 pixels, but the default slice and resize
    arguments reduce them to 62 x 47.

    Parameters
    ----------
    subset : {\'train\', \'test\', \'10_folds\'}, default=\'train\'
        Select the dataset to load: \'train\' for the development training
        set, \'test\' for the development test set, and \'10_folds\' for the
        official evaluation set that is meant to be used with a 10-folds
        cross validation.

    data_home : str, default=None
        Specify another download and cache folder for the datasets. By
        default all scikit-learn data is stored in \'~/scikit_learn_data\'
        subfolders.

    funneled : bool, default=True
        Download and use the funneled variant of the dataset.

    resize : float, default=0.5
        Ratio used to resize the each face picture.

    color : bool, default=False
        Keep the 3 RGB channels instead of averaging them to a single
        gray level channel. If color is True the shape of the data has
        one more dimension than the shape with color = False.

    slice_ : tuple of slice, default=(slice(70, 195), slice(78, 172))
        Provide a custom 2D slice (height, width) to extract the
        \'interesting\' part of the jpeg files and avoid use statistical
        correlation from the background.

    download_if_missing : bool, default=True
        If False, raise an OSError if the data is not locally available
        instead of trying to download the data from the source site.

    Returns
    -------
    data : :class:`~sklearn.utils.Bunch`
        Dictionary-like object, with the following attributes.

        data : ndarray of shape (2200, 5828). Shape depends on ``subset``.
            Each row corresponds to 2 ravel\'d face images
            of original size 62 x 47 pixels.
            Changing the ``slice_``, ``resize`` or ``subset`` parameters
            will change the shape of the output.
        pairs : ndarray of shape (2200, 2, 62, 47). Shape depends on ``subset``
            Each row has 2 face images corresponding
            to same or different person from the dataset
            containing 5749 people. Changing the ``slice_``,
            ``resize`` or ``subset`` parameters will change the shape of the
            output.
        target : numpy array of shape (2200,). Shape depends on ``subset``.

        target_names : numpy array of shape (2,)
