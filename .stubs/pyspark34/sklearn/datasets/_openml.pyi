    '''Fetch dataset from openml by name or dataset id.

    Datasets are uniquely identified by either an integer ID or by a
    combination of name and version (i.e. there might be multiple
    versions of the \'iris\' dataset). Please give either name or data_id
    (not both). In case a name is given, a version can also be
    provided.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <openml>`.

    .. versionadded:: 0.20

    .. note:: EXPERIMENTAL

        The API is experimental (particularly the return value structure),
        and might have small backward-incompatible changes without notice
        or warning in future releases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str, default=None
        String identifier of the dataset. Note that OpenML can have multiple
        datasets with the same name.

    version : int or \'active\', default=\'active\'
        Version of the dataset. Can only be provided if also ``name`` is given.
        If \'active\' the oldest version that\'s still active is used. Since
        there may be more than one active version of a dataset, and those
        versions may fundamentally be different from one another, setting an
        exact version is highly recommended.

    data_id : int, default=None
        OpenML ID of the dataset. The most specific way of retrieving a
        dataset. If data_id is not given, name (and potential version) are
        used to obtain a dataset.

    data_home : str, default=None
        Specify another download and cache folder for the data sets. By default
        all scikit-learn data is stored in \'~/scikit_learn_data\' subfolders.

    target_column : str, list or None, default=\'default-target\'
        Specify the column name in the data to use as target. If
        \'default-target\', the standard target column a stored on the server
        is used. If ``None``, all columns are returned as data and the
        target is ``None``. If list (of strings), all columns with these names
        are returned as multi-target (Note: not all scikit-learn classifiers
        can handle all types of multi-output combinations).

    cache : bool, default=True
        Whether to cache the downloaded datasets into `data_home`.

    return_X_y : bool, default=False
        If True, returns ``(data, target)`` instead of a Bunch object. See
        below for more information about the `data` and `target` objects.

    as_frame : bool or \'auto\', default=\'auto\'
        If True, the data is a pandas DataFrame including columns with
        appropriate dtypes (numeric, string or categorical). The target is
        a pandas DataFrame or Series depending on the number of target_columns.
        The Bunch will contain a ``frame`` attribute with the target and the
        data. If ``return_X_y`` is True, then ``(data, target)`` will be pandas
        DataFrames or Series as describe above.

        If `as_frame` is \'auto\', the data and target will be converted to
        DataFrame or Series as if `as_frame` is set to True, unless the dataset
        is stored in sparse format.

        If `as_frame` is False, the data and target will be NumPy arrays and
        the `data` will only contain numerical values when `parser="liac-arff"`
        where the categories are provided in the attribute `categories` of the
        `Bunch` instance. When `parser="pandas"`, no ordinal encoding is made.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.24
           The default value of `as_frame` changed from `False` to `\'auto\'`
           in 0.24.

    n_retries : int, default=3
        Number of retries when HTTP errors or network timeouts are encountered.
        Error with status code 412 won\'t be retried as they represent OpenML
        generic errors.

    delay : float, default=1.0
        Number of seconds between retries.

    parser : {"auto", "pandas", "liac-arff"}, default="liac-arff"
        Parser used to load the ARFF file. Two parsers are implemented:

        - `"pandas"`: this is the most efficient parser. However, it requires
          pandas to be installed and can only open dense datasets.
        - `"liac-arff"`: this is a pure Python ARFF parser that is much less
          memory- and CPU-efficient. It deals with sparse ARFF dataset.

        If `"auto"` (future default), the parser is chosen automatically such that
        `"liac-arff"` is selected for sparse ARFF datasets, otherwise
        `"pandas"` is selected.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2
        .. versionchanged:: 1.4
           The default value of `parser` will change from `"liac-arff"` to
           `"auto"` in 1.4. You can set `parser="auto"` to silence this
           warning. Therefore, an `ImportError` will be raised from 1.4 if
           the dataset is dense and pandas is not installed.

    read_csv_kwargs : dict, default=None
        Keyword arguments passed to :func:`pandas.read_csv` when loading the data
        from a ARFF file and using the pandas parser. It can allows to
        overwrite some default parameters.

        .. versionadded:: 1.3

    Returns
    -------
    data : :class:`~sklearn.utils.Bunch`
        Dictionary-like object, with the following attributes.

        data : np.array, scipy.sparse.csr_matrix of floats, or pandas DataFrame
            The feature matrix. Categorical features are encoded as ordinals.
        target : np.array, pandas Series or DataFrame
            The regression target or classification labels, if applicable.
            Dtype is float if numeric, and object if categorical. If
            ``as_frame`` is True, ``target`` is a pandas object.
        DESCR : str
            The full description of the dataset.
        feature_names : list
            The names of the dataset columns.
        target_names: list
            The names of the target columns.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

        categories : dict or None
            Maps each categorical feature name to a list of values, such
            that the value encoded as i is ith in the list. If ``as_frame``
            is True, this is None.
        details : dict
            More metadata from OpenML.
        frame : pandas DataFrame
            Only present when `as_frame=True`. DataFrame with ``data`` and
            ``target``.

    (data, target) : tuple if ``return_X_y`` is True

        .. note:: EXPERIMENTAL

            This interface is **experimental** and subsequent releases may
            change attributes without notice (although there should only be
            minor changes to ``data`` and ``target``).

        Missing values in the \'data\' are represented as NaN\'s. Missing values
        in \'target\' are represented as NaN\'s (numerical target) or None
        (categorical target).

    Notes
    -----
    The `"pandas"` and `"liac-arff"` parsers can lead to different data types
    in the output. The notable differences are the following:

    - The `"liac-arff"` parser always encodes categorical features as `str` objects.
      To the contrary, the `"pandas"` parser instead infers the type while
      reading and numerical categories will be casted into integers whenever
      possible.
    - The `"liac-arff"` parser uses float64 to encode numerical features
      tagged as \'REAL\' and \'NUMERICAL\' in the metadata. The `"pandas"`
      parser instead infers if these numerical features corresponds
      to integers and uses panda\'s Integer extension dtype.
    - In particular, classification datasets with integer categories are
      typically loaded as such `(0, 1, ...)` with the `"pandas"` parser while
      `"liac-arff"` will force the use of string encoded class labels such as
      `"0"`, `"1"` and so on.
    - The `"pandas"` parser will not strip single quotes - i.e. `\'` - from
      string columns. For instance, a string `\'my string\'` will be kept as is
      while the `"liac-arff"` parser will strip the single quotes. For
      categorical columns, the single quotes are stripped from the values.

    In addition, when `as_frame=False` is used, the `"liac-arff"` parser
    returns ordinally encoded data where the categories are provided in the
    attribute `categories` of the `Bunch` instance. Instead, `"pandas"` returns
    a NumPy array were the categories are not encoded.
