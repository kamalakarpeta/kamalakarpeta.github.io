def trustworthiness(X, X_embedded, *, n_neighbors: int = 5, metric: str = 'euclidean'):
    '''Indicate to what extent the local structure is retained.

    The trustworthiness is within [0, 1]. It is defined as

    .. math::

        T(k) = 1 - \\frac{2}{nk (2n - 3k - 1)} \\sum^n_{i=1}
            \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_{i}^{k}} \\max(0, (r(i, j) - k))

    where for each sample i, :math:`\\mathcal{N}_{i}^{k}` are its k nearest
    neighbors in the output space, and every sample j is its :math:`r(i, j)`-th
    nearest neighbor in the input space. In other words, any unexpected nearest
    neighbors in the output space are penalised in proportion to their rank in
    the input space.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features) or \\\n        (n_samples, n_samples)
        If the metric is \'precomputed\' X must be a square distance
        matrix. Otherwise it contains a sample per row.

    X_embedded : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_components)
        Embedding of the training data in low-dimensional space.

    n_neighbors : int, default=5
        The number of neighbors that will be considered. Should be fewer than
        `n_samples / 2` to ensure the trustworthiness to lies within [0, 1], as
        mentioned in [1]_. An error will be raised otherwise.

    metric : str or callable, default=\'euclidean\'
        Which metric to use for computing pairwise distances between samples
        from the original input space. If metric is \'precomputed\', X must be a
        matrix of pairwise distances or squared distances. Otherwise, for a list
        of available metrics, see the documentation of argument metric in
        `sklearn.pairwise.pairwise_distances` and metrics listed in
        `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.PAIRWISE_DISTANCE_FUNCTIONS`. Note that the
        "cosine" metric uses :func:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_distances`.

    Returns
    -------
    trustworthiness : float
        Trustworthiness of the low-dimensional embedding.

class TSNE(ClassNamePrefixFeaturesOutMixin, TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):
    '''T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding.

    t-SNE [1] is a tool to visualize high-dimensional data. It converts
    similarities between data points to joint probabilities and tries
    to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint
    probabilities of the low-dimensional embedding and the
    high-dimensional data. t-SNE has a cost function that is not convex,
    i.e. with different initializations we can get different results.

    It is highly recommended to use another dimensionality reduction
    method (e.g. PCA for dense data or TruncatedSVD for sparse data)
    to reduce the number of dimensions to a reasonable amount (e.g. 50)
    if the number of features is very high. This will suppress some
    noise and speed up the computation of pairwise distances between
    samples. For more tips see Laurens van der Maaten\'s FAQ [2].

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <t_sne>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_components : int, default=2
        Dimension of the embedded space.

    perplexity : float, default=30.0
        The perplexity is related to the number of nearest neighbors that
        is used in other manifold learning algorithms. Larger datasets
        usually require a larger perplexity. Consider selecting a value
        between 5 and 50. Different values can result in significantly
        different results. The perplexity must be less than the number
        of samples.

    early_exaggeration : float, default=12.0
        Controls how tight natural clusters in the original space are in
        the embedded space and how much space will be between them. For
        larger values, the space between natural clusters will be larger
        in the embedded space. Again, the choice of this parameter is not
        very critical. If the cost function increases during initial
        optimization, the early exaggeration factor or the learning rate
        might be too high.

    learning_rate : float or "auto", default="auto"
        The learning rate for t-SNE is usually in the range [10.0, 1000.0]. If
        the learning rate is too high, the data may look like a \'ball\' with any
        point approximately equidistant from its nearest neighbours. If the
        learning rate is too low, most points may look compressed in a dense
        cloud with few outliers. If the cost function gets stuck in a bad local
        minimum increasing the learning rate may help.
        Note that many other t-SNE implementations (bhtsne, FIt-SNE, openTSNE,
        etc.) use a definition of learning_rate that is 4 times smaller than
        ours. So our learning_rate=200 corresponds to learning_rate=800 in
        those other implementations. The \'auto\' option sets the learning_rate
        to `max(N / early_exaggeration / 4, 50)` where N is the sample size,
        following [4] and [5].

        .. versionchanged:: 1.2
           The default value changed to `"auto"`.

    n_iter : int, default=1000
        Maximum number of iterations for the optimization. Should be at
        least 250.

    n_iter_without_progress : int, default=300
        Maximum number of iterations without progress before we abort the
        optimization, used after 250 initial iterations with early
        exaggeration. Note that progress is only checked every 50 iterations so
        this value is rounded to the next multiple of 50.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           parameter *n_iter_without_progress* to control stopping criteria.

    min_grad_norm : float, default=1e-7
        If the gradient norm is below this threshold, the optimization will
        be stopped.

    metric : str or callable, default=\'euclidean\'
        The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a
        feature array. If metric is a string, it must be one of the options
        allowed by scipy.spatial.distance.pdist for its metric parameter, or
        a metric listed in pairwise.PAIRWISE_DISTANCE_FUNCTIONS.
        If metric is "precomputed", X is assumed to be a distance matrix.
        Alternatively, if metric is a callable function, it is called on each
        pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable
        should take two arrays from X as input and return a value indicating
        the distance between them. The default is "euclidean" which is
        interpreted as squared euclidean distance.

    metric_params : dict, default=None
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    init : {"random", "pca"} or ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_components),             default="pca"
        Initialization of embedding.
        PCA initialization cannot be used with precomputed distances and is
        usually more globally stable than random initialization.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.2
           The default value changed to `"pca"`.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Verbosity level.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines the random number generator. Pass an int for reproducible
        results across multiple function calls. Note that different
        initializations might result in different local minima of the cost
        function. See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    method : {\'barnes_hut\', \'exact\'}, default=\'barnes_hut\'
        By default the gradient calculation algorithm uses Barnes-Hut
        approximation running in O(NlogN) time. method=\'exact\'
        will run on the slower, but exact, algorithm in O(N^2) time. The
        exact algorithm should be used when nearest-neighbor errors need
        to be better than 3%. However, the exact method cannot scale to
        millions of examples.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           Approximate optimization *method* via the Barnes-Hut.

    angle : float, default=0.5
        Only used if method=\'barnes_hut\'
        This is the trade-off between speed and accuracy for Barnes-Hut T-SNE.
        \'angle\' is the angular size (referred to as theta in [3]) of a distant
        node as measured from a point. If this size is below \'angle\' then it is
        used as a summary node of all points contained within it.
        This method is not very sensitive to changes in this parameter
        in the range of 0.2 - 0.8. Angle less than 0.2 has quickly increasing
        computation time and angle greater 0.8 has quickly increasing error.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search. This parameter
        has no impact when ``metric="precomputed"`` or
        (``metric="euclidean"`` and ``method="exact"``).
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.
