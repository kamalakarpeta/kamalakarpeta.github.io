        API (e.g. as part of a preprocessing

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation will refuse to center scipy.sparse matrices
    since it would make them non-sparse and would potentially crash the
    program with memory exhaustion problems.

    Instead the caller is expected to either set explicitly
    `with_mean=False` (in that case, only variance scaling will be
    performed on the features of the CSC matrix) or to call `X.toarray()`
    if he/she expects the materialized dense array to fit in memory.

    To avoid memory copy the caller should pass a CSC matrix.

    NaNs are treated as missing values: disregarded to compute the statistics,
    and maintained during the data transformation.

    We use a biased estimator for the standard deviation, equivalent to
    `numpy.std(x, ddof=0)`. Note that the choice of `ddof` is unlikely to
    affect model performance.

    .. warning:: Risk of data leak

        Do not use :func:`~sklearn.preprocessing.scale` unless you know
        what you are doing. A common mistake is to apply it to the entire data
        *before* splitting into training and test sets. This will bias the
        model evaluation because information would have leaked from the test
        set to the training set.
        In general, we recommend using
        :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` within a
        :ref:`Pipeline <pipeline>` in order to prevent most risks of data
        leaking: `pipe = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), LogisticRegression())`.

class StandardScaler(OneToOneFeatureMixin, TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):
    """Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

    The standard score of a sample `x` is calculated as:

        z = (x - u) / s

    where `u` is the mean of the training samples or zero if `with_mean=False`,
    and `s` is the standard deviation of the training samples or one if
    `with_std=False`.

    Centering and scaling happen independently on each feature by computing
    the relevant statistics on the samples in the training set. Mean and
    standard deviation are then stored to be used on later data using
    :meth:`transform`.

    Standardization of a dataset is a common requirement for many
    machine learning estimators: they might behave badly if the
    individual features do not more or less look like standard normally
    distributed data (e.g. Gaussian with 0 mean and unit variance).

    For instance many elements used in the objective function of
    a learning algorithm (such as the RBF kernel of Support Vector
    Machines or the L1 and L2 regularizers of linear models) assume that
    all features are centered around 0 and have variance in the same
    order. If a feature has a variance that is orders of magnitude larger
    than others, it might dominate the objective function and make the
    estimator unable to learn from other features correctly as expected.

    This scaler can also be applied to sparse CSR or CSC matrices by passing
    `with_mean=False` to avoid breaking the sparsity structure of the data.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <preprocessing_scaler>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    copy : bool, default=True
        If False, try to avoid a copy and do inplace scaling instead.
        This is not guaranteed to always work inplace; e.g. if the data is
        not a NumPy array or scipy.sparse CSR matrix, a copy may still be
        returned.

    with_mean : bool, default=True
        If True, center the data before scaling.
        This does not work (and will raise an exception) when attempted on
        sparse matrices, because centering them entails building a dense
        matrix which in common use cases is likely to be too large to fit in
        memory.

    with_std : bool, default=True
        If True, scale the data to unit variance (or equivalently,
        unit standard deviation).

    Attributes
    ----------
    scale_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,) or None
        Per feature relative scaling of the data to achieve zero mean and unit
        variance. Generally this is calculated using `np.sqrt(var_)`. If a
        variance is zero, we can't achieve unit variance, and the data is left
        as-is, giving a scaling factor of 1. `scale_` is equal to `None`
        when `with_std=False`.

    mean_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,) or None

    var_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,) or None
        The variance for each feature in the training set. Used to compute
        `scale_`. Equal to ``None`` when ``with_std=False``.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    n_samples_seen_ : int or ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        The number of samples processed by the estimator for each feature.
        If there are no missing samples, the ``n_samples_seen`` will be an
        integer, otherwise it will be an array of dtype int. If
        `sample_weights` are used it will be a float (if no missing data)
        or an array of dtype float that sums the weights seen so far.

    .. warning:: Risk of data leak

        Do not use :func:`~sklearn.preprocessing.maxabs_scale` unless you know
        what you are doing. A common mistake is to apply it to the entire data
        *before* splitting into training and test sets. This will bias the
        model evaluation because information would have leaked from the test
        set to the training set.
        In general, we recommend using
        :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.MaxAbsScaler` within a
        :ref:`Pipeline <pipeline>` in order to prevent most risks of data
        leaking: `pipe = make_pipeline(MaxAbsScaler(), LogisticRegression())`.

class RobustScaler(OneToOneFeatureMixin, TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):
    """Scale features using statistics that are robust to outliers.

    This Scaler removes the median and scales the data according to
    the quantile range (defaults to IQR: Interquartile Range).
    The IQR is the range between the 1st quartile (25th quantile)
    and the 3rd quartile (75th quantile).

    Centering and scaling happen independently on each feature by
    computing the relevant statistics on the samples in the training
    set. Median and interquartile range are then stored to be used on
    later data using the :meth:`transform` method.

    Standardization of a dataset is a common requirement for many
    machine learning estimators. Typically this is done by removing the mean
    and scaling to unit variance. However, outliers can often influence the
    sample mean / variance in a negative way. In such cases, the median and
    the interquartile range often give better results.

    .. versionadded:: 0.17

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <preprocessing_scaler>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    with_centering : bool, default=True
        If `True`, center the data before scaling.
        This will cause :meth:`transform` to raise an exception when attempted
        on sparse matrices, because centering them entails building a dense
        matrix which in common use cases is likely to be too large to fit in
        memory.

    with_scaling : bool, default=True
        If `True`, scale the data to interquartile range.

    quantile_range : tuple (q_min, q_max), 0.0 < q_min < q_max < 100.0,         default=(25.0, 75.0)
        Quantile range used to calculate `scale_`. By default this is equal to
        the IQR, i.e., `q_min` is the first quantile and `q_max` is the third
        quantile.

        .. versionadded:: 0.18

    copy : bool, default=True
        If `False`, try to avoid a copy and do inplace scaling instead.
        This is not guaranteed to always work inplace; e.g. if the data is
        not a NumPy array or scipy.sparse CSR matrix, a copy may still be
        returned.

    unit_variance : bool, default=False
        If `True`, scale data so that normally distributed features have a
        variance of 1. In general, if the difference between the x-values of
        `q_max` and `q_min` for a standard normal distribution is greater
        than 1, the dataset will be scaled down. If less than 1, the dataset

    It can also be used as a pre-processing step for estimators that
    consider boolean random variables (e.g. modelled using the Bernoulli
    distribution in a Bayesian setting).

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <preprocessing_binarization>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold : float, default=0.0
        Feature values below or equal to this are replaced by 0, above it by 1.
        Threshold may not be less than 0 for operations on sparse matrices.

    copy : bool, default=True
        Set to False to perform inplace binarization and avoid a copy (if
        the input is already a numpy array or a scipy.sparse CSR matrix).

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`

    Notes
    -----
    If the input is a sparse matrix, only the non-zero values are subject
    to update by the :class:`Binarizer` class.

    This estimator is :term:`stateless` and does not need to be fitted.
    However, we recommend to call :meth:`fit_transform` instead of
    :meth:`transform`, as parameter validation is only performed in
    :meth:`fit`.

    .. warning:: Risk of data leak

        Do not use :func:`~sklearn.preprocessing.quantile_transform` unless

        to the entire data *before* splitting into training and

class PowerTransformer(OneToOneFeatureMixin, TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):
    '''Apply a power transform featurewise to make data more Gaussian-like.

    Power transforms are a family of parametric, monotonic transformations
    that are applied to make data more Gaussian-like. This is useful for
    modeling issues related to heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance),
    or other situations where normality is desired.

    Currently, PowerTransformer supports the Box-Cox transform and the
    Yeo-Johnson transform. The optimal parameter for stabilizing variance and
    minimizing skewness is estimated through maximum likelihood.

    Box-Cox requires input data to be strictly positive, while Yeo-Johnson
    supports both positive or negative data.

    By default, zero-mean, unit-variance normalization is applied to the
    transformed data.

def power_transform(X, method: str = 'yeo-johnson', *, standardize: bool = True, copy: bool = True):
    '''Parametric, monotonic transformation to make data more Gaussian-like.

    Power transforms are a family of parametric, monotonic transformations
    that are applied to make data more Gaussian-like. This is useful for
    modeling issues related to heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance),
    or other situations where normality is desired.

    Currently, power_transform supports the Box-Cox transform and the
    Yeo-Johnson transform. The optimal parameter for stabilizing variance and
    minimizing skewness is estimated through maximum likelihood.

    Box-Cox requires input data to be strictly positive, while Yeo-Johnson
    supports both positive or negative data.

    By default, zero-mean, unit-variance normalization is applied to the
    transformed data.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <preprocessing_transformer>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data to be transformed using a power transformation.

    method : {\'yeo-johnson\', \'box-cox\'}, default=\'yeo-johnson\'
        The power transform method. Available methods are:

        - \'yeo-johnson\' [1]_, works with positive and negative values
        - \'box-cox\' [2]_, only works with strictly positive values

        .. versionchanged:: 0.23
            The default value of the `method` parameter changed from
            \'box-cox\' to \'yeo-johnson\' in 0.23.

    standardize : bool, default=True
        Set to True to apply zero-mean, unit-variance normalization to the
        transformed output.

    copy : bool, default=True
        Set to False to perform inplace computation during transformation.

    Returns
    -------
    X_trans : ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The transformed data.

    See Also
    --------
    PowerTransformer : Equivalent transformation with the
        Transformer API (e.g. as part of a preprocessing
        :class:`~sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`).

    quantile_transform : Maps data to a standard normal distribution with
        the parameter `output_distribution=\'normal\'`.

    Notes
    -----
    NaNs are treated as missing values: disregarded in ``fit``, and maintained
    in ``transform``.

    .. warning:: Risk of data leak.
        Do not use :func:`~sklearn.preprocessing.power_transform` unless you
        know what you are doing. A common mistake is to apply it to the entire
        data *before* splitting into training and test sets. This will bias the
        model evaluation because information would have leaked from the test
        set to the training set.
        In general, we recommend using
        :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.PowerTransformer` within a
        :ref:`Pipeline <pipeline>` in order to prevent most risks of data
        leaking, e.g.: `pipe = make_pipeline(PowerTransformer(),
        LogisticRegression())`.
