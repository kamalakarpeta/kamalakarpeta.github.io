class PolynomialFeatures(TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):
    """Generate polynomial and interaction features.

    Generate a new feature matrix consisting of all polynomial combinations
    of the features with degree less than or equal to the specified degree.
    For example, if an input sample is two dimensional and of the form
    [a, b], the degree-2 polynomial features are [1, a, b, a^2, ab, b^2].

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <polynomial_features>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    degree : int or tuple (min_degree, max_degree), default=2
        If a single int is given, it specifies the maximal degree of the
        polynomial features. If a tuple `(min_degree, max_degree)` is passed,
        then `min_degree` is the minimum and `max_degree` is the maximum
        polynomial degree of the generated features. Note that `min_degree=0`
        and `min_degree=1` are equivalent as outputting the degree zero term is
        determined by `include_bias`.

    interaction_only : bool, default=False
        If `True`, only interaction features are produced: features that are
        products of at most `degree` *distinct* input features, i.e. terms with
        power of 2 or higher of the same input feature are excluded:

            - included: `x[0]`, `x[1]`, `x[0] * x[1]`, etc.
            - excluded: `x[0] ** 2`, `x[0] ** 2 * x[1]`, etc.

    include_bias : bool, default=True
        If `True` (default), then include a bias column, the feature in which
        all polynomial powers are zero (i.e. a column of ones - acts as an
        intercept term in a linear model).

    order : {'C', 'F'}, default='C'
        Order of output array in the dense case. `'F'` order is faster to
        compute, but may slow down subsequent estimators.

    Attributes
    ----------
    powers_ : ndarray of shape (`n_output_features_`, `n_features_in_`)
        `powers_[i, j]` is the exponent of the jth input in the ith output.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    n_output_features_ : int
        The total number of polynomial output features. The number of output
        features is computed by iterating over all suitably sized combinations
        of input features.

    SplineTransformer : Transformer that generates univariate B-spline bases
        for features.

    Notes
    -----
    Be aware that the number of features in the output array scales
    polynomially in the number of features of the input array, and
    exponentially in the degree. High degrees can cause overfitting.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
            The data to transform, row by row.

            Prefer CSR over CSC for sparse input (for speed), but CSC is
            required if the degree is 4 or higher. If the degree is less than
            4 and the input format is CSC, it will be converted to CSR, have
            its polynomial features generated, then converted back to CSC.

            If the degree is 2 or 3, the method described in "Leveraging
            Sparsity to Speed Up Polynomial Feature Expansions of CSR Matrices
            Using K-Simplex Numbers" by Andrew Nystrom and John Hughes is
            used, which is much faster than the method used on CSC input. For
            this reason, a CSC input will be converted to CSR, and the output
            will be converted back to CSC prior to being returned, hence the
            preference of CSR.

        Returns
        -------
        XP : {ndarray, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, NP)
            The matrix of features, where `NP` is the number of polynomial
            features generated from the combination of inputs. If a sparse
            matrix is provided, it will be converted into a sparse
            `csr_matrix`.

class SplineTransformer(TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):
    '''Generate univariate B-spline bases for features.

    Generate a new feature matrix consisting of
    `n_splines=n_knots + degree - 1` (`n_knots - 1` for
    `extrapolation="periodic"`) spline basis functions
    (B-splines) of polynomial order=`degree` for each feature.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <spline_transformer>`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_knots : int, default=5
        Number of knots of the splines if `knots` equals one of
        {\'uniform\', \'quantile\'}. Must be larger or equal 2. Ignored if `knots`
        is array-like.

    degree : int, default=3
        The polynomial degree of the spline basis. Must be a non-negative
        integer.

    knots : {\'uniform\', \'quantile\'} or array-like of shape         (n_knots, n_features), default=\'uniform\'
        Set knot positions such that first knot <= features <= last knot.

        - If \'uniform\', `n_knots` number of knots are distributed uniformly
          from min to max values of the features.
        - If \'quantile\', they are distributed uniformly along the quantiles of
          the features.
        - If an array-like is given, it directly specifies the sorted knot
          positions including the boundary knots. Note that, internally,
          `degree` number of knots are added before the first knot, the same
          after the last knot.

    extrapolation : {\'error\', \'constant\', \'linear\', \'continue\', \'periodic\'},         default=\'constant\'
        If \'error\', values outside the min and max values of the training
        features raises a `ValueError`. If \'constant\', the value of the
        splines at minimum and maximum value of the features is used as
        constant extrapolation. If \'linear\', a linear extrapolation is used.
        If \'continue\', the splines are extrapolated as is, i.e. option
        `extrapolate=True` in :class:`scipy.interpolate.BSpline`. If
        \'periodic\', periodic splines with a periodicity equal to the distance
        between the first and last knot are used. Periodic splines enforce
        equal function values and derivatives at the first and last knot.
        For example, this makes it possible to avoid introducing an arbitrary
        jump between Dec 31st and Jan 1st in spline features derived from a
        naturally periodic "day-of-year" input feature. In this case it is
        recommended to manually set the knot values to control the period.

    include_bias : bool, default=True
        If False, then the last spline element inside the data range
        of a feature is dropped. As B-splines sum to one over the spline basis
        functions for each data point, they implicitly include a bias term,
        i.e. a column of ones. It acts as an intercept term in a linear models.

    order : {\'C\', \'F\'}, default=\'C\'
        Order of output array in the dense case. `\'F\'` order is faster to compute, but
        may slow down subsequent estimators.

    sparse_output : bool, default=False
        Will return sparse CSR matrix if set True else will return an array. This
        option is only available with `scipy>=1.8`.

        The total number of input features.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    n_features_out_ : int
        The total number of output features, which is computed as
        `n_features * n_splines`, where `n_splines` is
        the number of bases elements of the B-splines,
        `n_knots + degree - 1` for non-periodic splines and
        `n_knots - 1` for periodic ones.
