    :ref:`examples/linear_model/plot_lasso_coordinate_descent_path.py
    <sphx_glr_auto_examples_linear_model_plot_lasso_coordinate_descent_path.py>`.

    To avoid unnecessary memory duplication the X argument of the fit method
    should be directly passed as a Fortran-contiguous numpy array.

    Note that in certain cases, the Lars solver may be significantly
    faster to implement this functionality. In particular, linear
    interpolation can be used to retrieve model coefficients between the
    values output by lars_path

class ElasticNet(MultiOutputMixin, RegressorMixin, LinearModel):
    '''Linear regression with combined L1 and L2 priors as regularizer.

    Minimizes the objective function::

            1 / (2 * n_samples) * ||y - Xw||^2_2
            + alpha * l1_ratio * ||w||_1
            + 0.5 * alpha * (1 - l1_ratio) * ||w||^2_2

    If you are interested in controlling the L1 and L2 penalty
    separately, keep in mind that this is equivalent to::

            a * ||w||_1 + 0.5 * b * ||w||_2^2

    where::

            alpha = a + b and l1_ratio = a / (a + b)

    The parameter l1_ratio corresponds to alpha in the glmnet R package while
    alpha corresponds to the lambda parameter in glmnet. Specifically, l1_ratio
    = 1 is the lasso penalty. Currently, l1_ratio <= 0.01 is not reliable,
    unless you supply your own sequence of alpha.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <elastic_net>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float, default=1.0
        Constant that multiplies the penalty terms. Defaults to 1.0.
        See the notes for the exact mathematical meaning of this
        parameter. ``alpha = 0`` is equivalent to an ordinary least square,
        solved by the :class:`LinearRegression` object. For numerical
        reasons, using ``alpha = 0`` with the ``Lasso`` object is not advised.
        Given this, you should use the :class:`LinearRegression` object.

    l1_ratio : float, default=0.5
        The ElasticNet mixing parameter, with ``0 <= l1_ratio <= 1``. For
        ``l1_ratio = 0`` the penalty is an L2 penalty. ``For l1_ratio = 1`` it
        is an L1 penalty.  For ``0 < l1_ratio < 1``, the penalty is a
        combination of L1 and L2.

    fit_intercept : bool, default=True
        Whether the intercept should be estimated or not. If ``False``, the
        data is assumed to be already centered.

    precompute : bool or array-like of shape (n_features, n_features),                 default=False
        Whether to use a precomputed Gram matrix to speed up
        calculations. The Gram matrix can also be passed as argument.
        For sparse input this option is always ``False`` to preserve sparsity.

    max_iter : int, default=1000
        The maximum number of iterations.

    copy_X : bool, default=True
        If ``True``, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        The tolerance for the optimization: if the updates are
        smaller than ``tol``, the optimization code checks the
        dual gap for optimality and continues until it is smaller
        than ``tol``, see Notes below.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as
        initialization, otherwise, just erase the previous solution.
        See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

    positive : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, forces the coefficients to be positive.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        The seed of the pseudo random number generator that selects a random
        feature to update. Used when ``selection`` == \'random\'.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    selection : {\'cyclic\', \'random\'}, default=\'cyclic\'
        If set to \'random\', a random coefficient is updated every iteration
        rather than looping over features sequentially by default. This
        (setting to \'random\') often leads to significantly faster convergence
        especially when tol is higher than 1e-4.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_targets, n_features)
        Parameter vector (w in the cost function formula).

    sparse_coef_ : sparse matrix of shape (n_features,) or             (n_targets, n_features)
        Sparse representation of the `coef_`.

    intercept_ : float or ndarray of shape (n_targets,)
        Independent term in decision function.

    n_iter_ : list of int
        Number of iterations run by the coordinate descent solver to reach
        the specified tolerance.

    dual_gap_ : float or ndarray of shape (n_targets,)
        Given param alpha, the dual gaps at the end of the optimization,
        same shape as each observation of y.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

    Notes
    -----
    To avoid unnecessary memory duplication the X argument of the fit method
    should be directly passed as a Fortran-contiguous numpy array.

    The precise stopping criteria based on `tol` are the following: First, check that
    that maximum coordinate update, i.e. :math:`\\max_j |w_j^{new} - w_j^{old}|`
    is smaller than `tol` times the maximum absolute coefficient, :math:`\\max_j |w_j|`.
    If so, then additionally check whether the dual gap is smaller than `tol` times
    :math:`||y||_2^2 / n_{\text{samples}}`.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm used to fit the model is coordinate descent.

    To avoid unnecessary memory duplication the X argument of the fit method
    should be directly passed as a Fortran-contiguous numpy array.

    Regularization improves the conditioning of the problem and
    reduces the variance of the estimates. Larger values specify stronger
    regularization. Alpha corresponds to `1 / (2C)` in other linear
    models such as :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` or
    :class:`~sklearn.svm.LinearSVC`. If an array is passed, penalties are
    assumed to be specific to the targets. Hence they must correspond in
    number.

    The precise stopping criteria based on `tol` are the following: First, check that
    that maximum coordinate update, i.e. :math:`\\max_j |w_j^{new} - w_j^{old}|`
    is smaller than `tol` times the maximum absolute coefficient, :math:`\\max_j |w_j|`.
    If so, then additionally check whether the dual gap is smaller than `tol` times
    :math:`||y||_2^2 / n_{\\text{samples}}`.

    The target can be a 2-dimensional array, resulting in the optimization of the
    following objective::

        (1 / (2 * n_samples)) * ||Y - XW||^2_F + alpha * ||W||_11

    where :math:`||W||_{1,1}` is the sum of the magnitude of the matrix coefficients.
    It should not be confused with :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.MultiTaskLasso` which
    instead penalizes the :math:`L_{2,1}` norm of the coefficients, yielding row-wise
    sparsity in the coefficients.

    Parameters
    ----------
    eps : float, default=1e-3
        Length of the path. ``eps=1e-3`` means that

    max_iter : int, default=1000
        The maximum number of iterations.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        The tolerance for the optimization: if the updates are

        For int/None inputs, :class:`KFold` is used.

        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

    positive : bool, default=False

    Notes
    -----
    In `fit`, once the best parameter `alpha` is found through

    To avoid unnecessary memory duplication the `X` argument of the `fit`
    method should be directly passed as a Fortran-contiguous numpy array.

     <sphx_glr_auto_examples_linear_model_plot_lasso_model_selection.py>`.

    :class:`LassoCV` leads to different results than a hyperparameter
    search using :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` with a
    :class:`Lasso` model. In :class:`LassoCV`, a model for a given
    penalty `alpha` is warm started using the coefficients of the
    closest model (trained at the previous iteration) on the
    regularization path. It tends to speed up the hyperparameter
    search.

    Notes
    -----
    In `fit`, once the best parameters `l1_ratio` and `alpha` are found through
    cross-validation, the model is fit again using the entire training set.

    To avoid unnecessary memory duplication the `X` argument of the `fit`
    method should be directly passed as a Fortran-contiguous numpy array.

    The parameter `l1_ratio` corresponds to alpha in the glmnet R package
    while alpha corresponds to the lambda parameter in glmnet.
    More specifically, the optimization objective is::

        1 / (2 * n_samples) * ||y - Xw||^2_2
        + alpha * l1_ratio * ||w||_1
        + 0.5 * alpha * (1 - l1_ratio) * ||w||^2_2

    If you are interested in controlling the L1 and L2 penalty
    separately, keep in mind that this is equivalent to::

        a * L1 + b * L2

    for::

        alpha = a + b and l1_ratio = a / (a + b).

    ----------

        than ``tol``.

    warm_start : bool, default=False

    Parameters
    ----------
    l1_ratio : float or list of float, default=0.5
        The ElasticNet mixing parameter, with 0 < l1_ratio <= 1.
        For l1_ratio = 1 the penalty is an L1/L2 penalty. For l1_ratio = 0 it
        is an L2 penalty.
        For ``0 < l1_ratio < 1``, the penalty is a combination of L1/L2 and L2.
        This parameter can be a list, in which case the different
        values are tested by cross-validation and the one giving the best
        prediction score is used. Note that a good choice of list of
        values for l1_ratio is often to put more values close to 1
        (i.e. Lasso) and less close to 0 (i.e. Ridge), as in ``[.1, .5, .7,
        .9, .95, .99, 1]``.

    eps : float, default=1e-3
        Length of the path. ``eps=1e-3`` means that
        ``alpha_min / alpha_max = 1e-3``.

        (i.e. data is expected to be centered).

    max_iter : int, default=1000
        The maximum number of iterations.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        The tolerance for the optimization: if the updates are
        smaller than ``tol``, the optimization code checks the
        dual gap for optimality and continues until it is smaller
        than ``tol``.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or iterable, default=None
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 5-fold cross-validation,
        - int, to specify the number of folds.
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For int/None inputs, :class:`KFold` is used.

    verbose : bool or int, default=0
        Amount of verbosity.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        Number of CPUs to use during the cross validation. Note that this is
        used only if multiple values for l1_ratio are given.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        The seed of the pseudo random number generator that selects a random
        feature to update. Used when ``selection`` == 'random'.
