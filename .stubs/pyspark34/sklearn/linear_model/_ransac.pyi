class RANSACRegressor(MetaEstimatorMixin, RegressorMixin, MultiOutputMixin, BaseEstimator):
    """RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) algorithm.

    RANSAC is an iterative algorithm for the robust estimation of parameters
    from a subset of inliers from the complete data set.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <ransac_regression>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object, default=None
        Base estimator object which implements the following methods:

         * `fit(X, y)`: Fit model to given training data and target values.
         * `score(X, y)`: Returns the mean accuracy on the given test data,
           which is used for the stop criterion defined by `stop_score`.
           Additionally, the score is used to decide which of two equally
           large consensus sets is chosen as the better one.
         * `predict(X)`: Returns predicted values using the linear model,
           which is used to compute residual error using loss function.

        If `estimator` is None, then
        :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` is used for
        target values of dtype float.

        Note that the current implementation only supports regression
        estimators.

    min_samples : int (>= 1) or float ([0, 1]), default=None
        Minimum number of samples chosen randomly from original data. Treated
        as an absolute number of samples for `min_samples >= 1`, treated as a
        relative number `ceil(min_samples * X.shape[0])` for
        `min_samples < 1`. This is typically chosen as the minimal number of
        samples necessary to estimate the given `estimator`. By default a
        ``sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()`` estimator is assumed and
        `min_samples` is chosen as ``X.shape[1] + 1``. This parameter is highly
        dependent upon the model, so if a `estimator` other than
        :class:`linear_model.LinearRegression` is used, the user must provide a value.

    residual_threshold : float, default=None
        Maximum residual for a data sample to be classified as an inlier.
        By default the threshold is chosen as the MAD (median absolute
        deviation) of the target values `y`. Points whose residuals are
        strictly equal to the threshold are considered as inliers.

    is_data_valid : callable, default=None
        This function is called with the randomly selected data before the
        model is fitted to it: `is_data_valid(X, y)`. If its return value is
        False the current randomly chosen sub-sample is skipped.

    is_model_valid : callable, default=None
        This function is called with the estimated model and the randomly
        selected data: `is_model_valid(model, X, y)`. If its return value is
        False the current randomly chosen sub-sample is skipped.
        Rejecting samples with this function is computationally costlier than
        with `is_data_valid`. `is_model_valid` should therefore only be used if
        the estimated model is needed for making the rejection decision.

    max_trials : int, default=100
        Maximum number of iterations for random sample selection.

    max_skips : int, default=np.inf
        Maximum number of iterations that can be skipped due to finding zero
        inliers or invalid data defined by ``is_data_valid`` or invalid models
        defined by ``is_model_valid``.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    stop_n_inliers : int, default=np.inf
        Stop iteration if at least this number of inliers are found.

    stop_score : float, default=np.inf
        Stop iteration if score is greater equal than this threshold.

    stop_probability : float in range [0, 1], default=0.99
        RANSAC iteration stops if at least one outlier-free set of the training
        data is sampled in RANSAC. This requires to generate at least N
        samples (iterations)::

            N >= log(1 - probability) / log(1 - e**m)

        where the probability (confidence) is typically set to high value such
        as 0.99 (the default) and e is the current fraction of inliers w.r.t.
        the total number of samples.

    loss : str, callable, default='absolute_error'
        String inputs, 'absolute_error' and 'squared_error' are supported which
        find the absolute error and squared error per sample respectively.

        If ``loss`` is a callable, then it should be a function that takes
        two arrays as inputs, the true and predicted value and returns a 1-D
        array with the i-th value of the array corresponding to the loss
        on ``X[i]``.

        If the loss on a sample is greater than the ``residual_threshold``,
        then this sample is classified as an outlier.

        .. versionadded:: 0.18

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        The generator used to initialize the centers.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.
