class TheilSenRegressor(RegressorMixin, LinearModel):
    '''Theil-Sen Estimator: robust multivariate regression model.

    The algorithm calculates least square solutions on subsets with size
    n_subsamples of the samples in X. Any value of n_subsamples between the
    number of features and samples leads to an estimator with a compromise
    between robustness and efficiency. Since the number of least square
    solutions is "n_samples choose n_subsamples", it can be extremely large
    and can therefore be limited with max_subpopulation. If this limit is
    reached, the subsets are chosen randomly. In a final step, the spatial
    median (or L1 median) is calculated of all least square solutions.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <theil_sen_regression>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fit_intercept : bool, default=True
        Whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set
        to false, no intercept will be used in calculations.

    copy_X : bool, default=True
        If True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

    max_subpopulation : int, default=1e4
        Instead of computing with a set of cardinality \'n choose k\', where n is
        the number of samples and k is the number of subsamples (at least
        number of features), consider only a stochastic subpopulation of a
        given maximal size if \'n choose k\' is larger than max_subpopulation.
        For other than small problem sizes this parameter will determine
        memory usage and runtime if n_subsamples is not changed. Note that the
        data type should be int but floats such as 1e4 can be accepted too.

    n_subsamples : int, default=None
        Number of samples to calculate the parameters. This is at least the
        number of features (plus 1 if fit_intercept=True) and the number of
        samples as a maximum. A lower number leads to a higher breakdown
        point and a low efficiency while a high number leads to a low
        breakdown point and a high efficiency. If None, take the
        minimum number of subsamples leading to maximal robustness.
        If n_subsamples is set to n_samples, Theil-Sen is identical to least
        squares.

    max_iter : int, default=300
        Maximum number of iterations for the calculation of spatial median.

    tol : float, default=1e-3
        Tolerance when calculating spatial median.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        A random number generator instance to define the state of the random
        permutations generator. Pass an int for reproducible output across
        multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        Number of CPUs to use during the cross validation.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Verbose mode when fitting the model.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        Coefficients of the regression model (median of distribution).

    intercept_ : float
        Estimated intercept of regression model.

    breakdown_ : float
        Approximated breakdown point.

    n_iter_ : int
        Number of iterations needed for the spatial median.

    n_subpopulation_ : int
        Number of combinations taken into account from \'n choose k\', where n is
        the number of samples and k is the number of subsamples.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0
