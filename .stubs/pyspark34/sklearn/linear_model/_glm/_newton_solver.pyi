class NewtonSolver(ABC, metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    '''Newton solver for GLMs.

    This class implements Newton/2nd-order optimization routines for GLMs. Each Newton
    iteration aims at finding the Newton step which is done by the inner solver. With
    Hessian H, gradient g and coefficients coef, one step solves:

        H @ coef_newton = -g

    For our GLM / LinearModelLoss, we have gradient g and Hessian H:

        g = X.T @ loss.gradient + l2_reg_strength * coef
        H = X.T @ diag(loss.hessian) @ X + l2_reg_strength * identity

    Backtracking line search updates coef = coef_old + t * coef_newton for some t in
    (0, 1].

    This is a base class, actual implementations (child classes) may deviate from the
    above pattern and use structure specific tricks.

    Usage pattern:
        - initialize solver: sol = NewtonSolver(...)
        - solve the problem: sol.solve(X, y, sample_weight)

    Parameters
    ----------
    coef : ndarray of shape (n_dof,), (n_classes, n_dof) or (n_classes * n_dof,)
        Initial coefficients of a linear model.
        If shape (n_classes * n_dof,), the classes of one feature are contiguous,
        i.e. one reconstructs the 2d-array via
        coef.reshape((n_classes, -1), order="F").

    linear_loss : LinearModelLoss
        The loss to be minimized.

    l2_reg_strength : float, default=0.0
        L2 regularization strength.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        The optimization problem is solved when each of the following condition is
        fulfilled:
        1. maximum |gradient| <= tol
        2. Newton decrement d: 1/2 * d^2 <= tol

    max_iter : int, default=100
        Maximum number of Newton steps allowed.

    n_threads : int, default=1
        Number of OpenMP threads to use for the computation of the Hessian and gradient
        of the loss function.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_old : ndarray of shape coef.shape
        Coefficient of previous iteration.

    coef_newton : ndarray of shape coef.shape
        Newton step.

    gradient : ndarray of shape coef.shape
        Gradient of the loss w.r.t. the coefficients.

    gradient_old : ndarray of shape coef.shape
        Gradient of previous iteration.

    loss_value : float
        Value of objective function = loss + penalty.

    loss_value_old : float
        Value of objective function of previous itertion.

    raw_prediction : ndarray of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_classes)

    converged : bool
        Indicator for convergence of the solver.

    iteration : int
        Number of Newton steps, i.e. calls to inner_solve

    use_fallback_lbfgs_solve : bool
        If set to True, the solver will resort to call LBFGS to finish the optimisation
        procedure in case of convergence issues.

    gradient_times_newton : float
        gradient @ coef_newton, set in inner_solve and used by line_search. If the
        Newton step is a descent direction, this is negative.
