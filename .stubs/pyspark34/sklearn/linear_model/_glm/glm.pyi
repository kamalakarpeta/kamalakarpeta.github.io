class _GeneralizedLinearRegressor(RegressorMixin, BaseEstimator):
    """Regression via a penalized Generalized Linear Model (GLM).

    GLMs based on a reproductive Exponential Dispersion Model (EDM) aim at fitting and
    predicting the mean of the target y as y_pred=h(X*w) with coefficients w.
    Therefore, the fit minimizes the following objective function with L2 priors as
    regularizer::

        1/(2*sum(s_i)) * sum(s_i * deviance(y_i, h(x_i*w)) + 1/2 * alpha * ||w||_2^2

    with inverse link function h, s=sample_weight and per observation (unit) deviance
    deviance(y_i, h(x_i*w)). Note that for an EDM, 1/2 * deviance is the negative
    log-likelihood up to a constant (in w) term.
    The parameter ``alpha`` corresponds to the lambda parameter in glmnet.

    Instead of implementing the EDM family and a link function separately, we directly
    use the loss functions `from sklearn._loss` which have the link functions included
    in them for performance reasons. We pick the loss functions that implement
    (1/2 times) EDM deviances.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <Generalized_linear_models>`.

    .. versionadded:: 0.23

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float, default=1
        Constant that multiplies the penalty term and thus determines the
        regularization strength. ``alpha = 0`` is equivalent to unpenalized
        GLMs. In this case, the design matrix `X` must have full column rank
        (no collinearities).
        Values must be in the range `[0.0, inf)`.

    fit_intercept : bool, default=True
        Specifies if a constant (a.k.a. bias or intercept) should be
        added to the linear predictor (X @ coef + intercept).

    solver : {'lbfgs', 'newton-cholesky'}, default='lbfgs'
        Algorithm to use in the optimization problem:

        'lbfgs'
            Calls scipy's L-BFGS-B optimizer.

        'newton-cholesky'
            Uses Newton-Raphson steps (in arbitrary precision arithmetic equivalent to
            iterated reweighted least squares) with an inner Cholesky based solver.
            This solver is a good choice for `n_samples` >> `n_features`, especially
            with one-hot encoded categorical features with rare categories. Be aware
            that the memory usage of this solver has a quadratic dependency on
            `n_features` because it explicitly computes the Hessian matrix.

            .. versionadded:: 1.2

    max_iter : int, default=100
        The maximal number of iterations for the solver.
        Values must be in the range `[1, inf)`.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        Stopping criterion. For the lbfgs solver,
        the iteration will stop when ``max{|g_j|, j = 1, ..., d} <= tol``
        where ``g_j`` is the j-th component of the gradient (derivative) of
        the objective function.
        Values must be in the range `(0.0, inf)`.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        If set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to ``fit``
        as initialization for ``coef_`` and ``intercept_``.

    verbose : int, default=0
        For the lbfgs solver set verbose to any positive number for verbosity.
        Values must be in the range `[0, inf)`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : array of shape (n_features,)
        Estimated coefficients for the linear predictor (`X @ coef_ +
        intercept_`) in the GLM.

    intercept_ : float
        Intercept (a.k.a. bias) added to linear predictor.

    n_iter_ : int
        Actual number of iterations used in the solver.

    _base_loss : BaseLoss, default=HalfSquaredError()
        This is set during fit via `self._get_loss()`.
        A `_base_loss` contains a specific loss function as well as the link
        function. The loss to be minimized specifies the distributional assumption of
        the GLM, i.e. the distribution from the EDM. Here are some examples:

        =======================  ========  ==========================
        _base_loss               Link      Target Domain
        =======================  ========  ==========================
        HalfSquaredError         identity  y any real number
        HalfPoissonLoss          log       0 <= y
        HalfGammaLoss            log       0 < y
        HalfTweedieLoss          log       dependent on tweedie power
        HalfTweedieLossIdentity  identity  dependent on tweedie power
        =======================  ========  ==========================

        The link function of the GLM, i.e. mapping from linear predictor
        `X @ coeff + intercept` to prediction `y_pred`. For instance, with a log link,
        we have `y_pred = exp(X @ coeff + intercept)`.
