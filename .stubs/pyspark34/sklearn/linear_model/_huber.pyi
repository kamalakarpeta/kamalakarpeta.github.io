class HuberRegressor(LinearModel, RegressorMixin, BaseEstimator):
    '''L2-regularized linear regression model that is robust to outliers.

    The Huber Regressor optimizes the squared loss for the samples where
    ``|(y - Xw - c) / sigma| < epsilon`` and the absolute loss for the samples
    where ``|(y - Xw - c) / sigma| > epsilon``, where the model coefficients
    ``w``, the intercept ``c`` and the scale ``sigma`` are parameters
    to be optimized. The parameter sigma makes sure that if y is scaled up
    or down by a certain factor, one does not need to rescale epsilon to
    achieve the same robustness. Note that this does not take into account
    the fact that the different features of X may be of different scales.

    The Huber loss function has the advantage of not being heavily influenced
    by the outliers while not completely ignoring their effect.

    Parameters
    ----------
    epsilon : float, default=1.35
        The parameter epsilon controls the number of samples that should be
        classified as outliers. The smaller the epsilon, the more robust it is
        to outliers. Epsilon must be in the range `[1, inf)`.

    max_iter : int, default=100
        Maximum number of iterations that
        ``scipy.optimize.minimize(method="L-BFGS-B")`` should run for.

    alpha : float, default=0.0001
        Strength of the squared L2 regularization. Note that the penalty is
        equal to ``alpha * ||w||^2``.
        Must be in the range `[0, inf)`.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        This is useful if the stored attributes of a previously used model
        has to be reused. If set to False, then the coefficients will
        be rewritten for every call to fit.
        See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

    fit_intercept : bool, default=True
        Whether or not to fit the intercept. This can be set to False
        if the data is already centered around the origin.

    tol : float, default=1e-05
        The iteration will stop when
        ``max{|proj g_i | i = 1, ..., n}`` <= ``tol``
        where pg_i is the i-th component of the projected gradient.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : array, shape (n_features,)
        Features got by optimizing the L2-regularized Huber loss.

    intercept_ : float
        Bias.

    scale_ : float
        The value by which ``|y - Xw - c|`` is scaled down.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    n_iter_ : int
        Number of iterations that
        ``scipy.optimize.minimize(method="L-BFGS-B")`` has run for.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20

            In SciPy <= 1.0.0 the number of lbfgs iterations may exceed
            ``max_iter``. ``n_iter_`` will now report at most ``max_iter``.

    outliers_ : array, shape (n_samples,)
        A boolean mask which is set to True where the samples are identified
        as outliers.
