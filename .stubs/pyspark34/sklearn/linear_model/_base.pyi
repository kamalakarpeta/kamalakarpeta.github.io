        Converts the ``coef_`` member to a scipy.sparse matrix, which for

        Notes
        -----
        For non-sparse models, i.e. when there are not many zeros in ``coef_``,
        this may actually *increase* memory usage, so use this method with
        care. A rule of thumb is that the number of zero elements, which can
        be computed with ``(coef_ == 0).sum()``, must be more than 50% for this
        to provide significant benefits.

        After calling this method, further fitting with the partial_fit
        method (if any) will not work until you call densify.

class LinearRegression(MultiOutputMixin, RegressorMixin, LinearModel):
    """
    Ordinary least squares Linear Regression.

    LinearRegression fits a linear model with coefficients w = (w1, ..., wp)
    to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in
    the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fit_intercept : bool, default=True
        Whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set
        to False, no intercept will be used in calculations
        (i.e. data is expected to be centered).

    copy_X : bool, default=True
        If True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to use for the computation. This will only provide
        speedup in case of sufficiently large problems, that is if firstly
        `n_targets > 1` and secondly `X` is sparse or if `positive` is set
        to `True`. ``None`` means 1 unless in a
        :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all
        processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>` for more details.

    positive : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, forces the coefficients to be positive. This
        option is only supported for dense arrays.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : array of shape (n_features, ) or (n_targets, n_features)
        Estimated coefficients for the linear regression problem.
        If multiple targets are passed during the fit (y 2D), this
        is a 2D array of shape (n_targets, n_features), while if only
        one target is passed, this is a 1D array of length n_features.

    rank_ : int
        Rank of matrix `X`. Only available when `X` is dense.

    singular_ : array of shape (min(X, y),)
        Singular values of `X`. Only available when `X` is dense.

    intercept_ : float or array of shape (n_targets,)
        Independent term in the linear model. Set to 0.0 if
        `fit_intercept = False`.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0
