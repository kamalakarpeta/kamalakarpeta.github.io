class MLPClassifier(ClassifierMixin, BaseMultilayerPerceptron):
    '''Multi-layer Perceptron classifier.

    This model optimizes the log-loss function using LBFGS or stochastic
    gradient descent.

    .. versionadded:: 0.18

    Parameters
    ----------
    hidden_layer_sizes : array-like of shape(n_layers - 2,), default=(100,)
        The ith element represents the number of neurons in the ith
        hidden layer.

    activation : {\'identity\', \'logistic\', \'tanh\', \'relu\'}, default=\'relu\'
        Activation function for the hidden layer.

        - \'identity\', no-op activation, useful to implement linear bottleneck,
          returns f(x) = x

        - \'logistic\', the logistic sigmoid function,
          returns f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)).

        - \'tanh\', the hyperbolic tan function,
          returns f(x) = tanh(x).

        - \'relu\', the rectified linear unit function,
          returns f(x) = max(0, x)

    solver : {\'lbfgs\', \'sgd\', \'adam\'}, default=\'adam\'
        The solver for weight optimization.

        - \'lbfgs\' is an optimizer in the family of quasi-Newton methods.

        - \'sgd\' refers to stochastic gradient descent.

        - \'adam\' refers to a stochastic gradient-based optimizer proposed
          by Kingma, Diederik, and Jimmy Ba

        Note: The default solver \'adam\' works pretty well on relatively
        large datasets (with thousands of training samples or more) in terms of
        both training time and validation score.
        For small datasets, however, \'lbfgs\' can converge faster and perform
        better.

    alpha : float, default=0.0001
        Strength of the L2 regularization term. The L2 regularization term
        is divided by the sample size when added to the loss.

    batch_size : int, default=\'auto\'
        Size of minibatches for stochastic optimizers.
        If the solver is \'lbfgs\', the classifier will not use minibatch.
        When set to "auto", `batch_size=min(200, n_samples)`.

    learning_rate : {\'constant\', \'invscaling\', \'adaptive\'}, default=\'constant\'
        Learning rate schedule for weight updates.

        - \'constant\' is a constant learning rate given by
          \'learning_rate_init\'.

        - \'invscaling\' gradually decreases the learning rate at each
          time step \'t\' using an inverse scaling exponent of \'power_t\'.
          effective_learning_rate = learning_rate_init / pow(t, power_t)

        - \'adaptive\' keeps the learning rate constant to
          \'learning_rate_init\' as long as training loss keeps decreasing.
          Each time two consecutive epochs fail to decrease training loss by at
          least tol, or fail to increase validation score by at least tol if
          \'early_stopping\' is on, the current learning rate is divided by 5.

        Only used when ``solver=\'sgd\'``.

    learning_rate_init : float, default=0.001
        The initial learning rate used. It controls the step-size
        in updating the weights. Only used when solver=\'sgd\' or \'adam\'.

    power_t : float, default=0.5
        The exponent for inverse scaling learning rate.
        It is used in updating effective learning rate when the learning_rate
        is set to \'invscaling\'. Only used when solver=\'sgd\'.

    max_iter : int, default=200
        Maximum number of iterations. The solver iterates until convergence
        (determined by \'tol\') or this number of iterations. For stochastic
        solvers (\'sgd\', \'adam\'), note that this determines the number of epochs
        (how many times each data point will be used), not the number of
        gradient steps.

    shuffle : bool, default=True
        Whether to shuffle samples in each iteration. Only used when
        solver=\'sgd\' or \'adam\'.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        Determines random number generation for weights and bias
        initialization, train-test split if early stopping is used, and batch
        sampling when solver=\'sgd\' or \'adam\'.
        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        Tolerance for the optimization. When the loss or score is not improving
        by at least ``tol`` for ``n_iter_no_change`` consecutive iterations,
        unless ``learning_rate`` is set to \'adaptive\', convergence is
        considered to be reached and training stops.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Whether to print progress messages to stdout.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous
        call to fit as initialization, otherwise, just erase the
        previous solution. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

    momentum : float, default=0.9
        Momentum for gradient descent update. Should be between 0 and 1. Only
        used when solver=\'sgd\'.

    nesterovs_momentum : bool, default=True
        Whether to use Nesterov\'s momentum. Only used when solver=\'sgd\' and
        momentum > 0.

    early_stopping : bool, default=False
        Whether to use early stopping to terminate training when validation
        score is not improving. If set to true, it will automatically set
        aside 10% of training data as validation and terminate training when
        validation score is not improving by at least tol for
        ``n_iter_no_change`` consecutive epochs. The split is stratified,
        except in a multilabel setting.
        If early stopping is False, then the training stops when the training
        loss does not improve by more than tol for n_iter_no_change consecutive
        passes over the training set.
        Only effective when solver=\'sgd\' or \'adam\'.

    validation_fraction : float, default=0.1
        The proportion of training data to set aside as validation set for
        early stopping. Must be between 0 and 1.
        Only used if early_stopping is True.

    beta_1 : float, default=0.9
        Exponential decay rate for estimates of first moment vector in adam,
        should be in [0, 1). Only used when solver=\'adam\'.

    beta_2 : float, default=0.999
        Exponential decay rate for estimates of second moment vector in adam,
        should be in [0, 1). Only used when solver=\'adam\'.

    epsilon : float, default=1e-8
        Value for numerical stability in adam. Only used when solver=\'adam\'.

    n_iter_no_change : int, default=10
        Maximum number of epochs to not meet ``tol`` improvement.
        Only effective when solver=\'sgd\' or \'adam\'.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    max_fun : int, default=15000
        Only used when solver=\'lbfgs\'. Maximum number of loss function calls.
        The solver iterates until convergence (determined by \'tol\'), number
        of iterations reaches max_iter, or this number of loss function calls.
        Note that number of loss function calls will be greater than or equal
        to the number of iterations for the `MLPClassifier`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    best_validation_score_ : float or None
        The best validation score (i.e. accuracy score) that triggered the

    Notes
    -----
    MLPClassifier trains iteratively since at each time step
    the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to the model
    parameters are computed to update the parameters.

    It can also have a regularization term added to the loss function
    that shrinks model parameters to prevent overfitting.

    This implementation works with data represented as dense numpy arrays or
    sparse scipy arrays of floating point values.

    beta_1 : float, default=0.9
        Exponential decay rate for estimates of first moment vector in adam,
        should be in [0, 1). Only used when solver=\'adam\'.

    beta_2 : float, default=0.999
        Exponential decay rate for estimates of second moment vector in adam,
        should be in [0, 1). Only used when solver=\'adam\'.

    epsilon : float, default=1e-8
        Value for numerical stability in adam. Only used when solver=\'adam\'.

    n_iter_no_change : int, default=10
        Maximum number of epochs to not meet ``tol`` improvement.
        Only effective when solver=\'sgd\' or \'adam\'.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    max_fun : int, default=15000
        Only used when solver=\'lbfgs\'. Maximum number of function calls.
        The solver iterates until convergence (determined by ``tol``), number
        of iterations reaches max_iter, or this number of function calls.
        Note that number of function calls will be greater than or equal to
        the number of iterations for the MLPRegressor.

    Attributes
    ----------
    loss_ : float
        The current loss computed with the loss function.

    best_loss_ : float
        The minimum loss reached by the solver throughout fitting.
        If `early_stopping=True`, this attribute is set to `None`. Refer to
        the `best_validation_score_` fitted attribute instead.
        Only accessible when solver=\'sgd\' or \'adam\'.

    loss_curve_ : list of shape (`n_iter_`,)
        Loss value evaluated at the end of each training step.
        The ith element in the list represents the loss at the ith iteration.
        Only accessible when solver=\'sgd\' or \'adam\'.

    validation_scores_ : list of shape (`n_iter_`,) or None
        The score at each iteration on a held-out validation set. The score
        reported is the R2 score. Only available if `early_stopping=True`,
        otherwise the attribute is set to `None`.
        Only accessible when solver=\'sgd\' or \'adam\'.

    best_validation_score_ : float or None
        The best validation score (i.e. R2 score) that triggered the
        early stopping. Only available if `early_stopping=True`, otherwise the
        attribute is set to `None`.
        Only accessible when solver=\'sgd\' or \'adam\'.

    t_ : int
        The number of training samples seen by the solver during fitting.
        Mathematically equals `n_iters * X.shape[0]`, it means
        `time_step` and it is used by optimizer\'s learning rate scheduler.

    coefs_ : list of shape (n_layers - 1,)
        The ith element in the list represents the weight matrix corresponding
        to layer i.

    intercepts_ : list of shape (n_layers - 1,)
        The ith element in the list represents the bias vector corresponding to
        layer i + 1.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    n_iter_ : int
        The number of iterations the solver has run.

    n_layers_ : int
        Number of layers.

    n_outputs_ : int
        Number of outputs.

    out_activation_ : str
        Name of the output activation function.

    sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor : Linear model fitted by minimizing
        a regularized empirical loss with SGD.

    Notes
    -----
    MLPRegressor trains iteratively since at each time step
    the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to the model
    parameters are computed to update the parameters.

    It can also have a regularization term added to the loss function
    that shrinks model parameters to prevent overfitting.

    This implementation works with data represented as dense and sparse numpy
    arrays of floating point values.
