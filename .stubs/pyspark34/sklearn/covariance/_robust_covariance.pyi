    """C_step procedure described in [Rouseeuw1984]_ aiming at computing MCD.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Data set in which we look for the n_support observations whose
        scatter matrix has minimum determinant.

    n_support : int
        Number of observations to compute the robust estimates of location
        and covariance from. This parameter must be greater than
        `n_samples / 2`.

    remaining_iterations : int, default=30
        Number of iterations to perform.
        According to [Rouseeuw1999]_, two iterations are sufficient to get
        close to the minimum, and we never need more than 30 to reach
        convergence.

    initial_estimates : tuple of shape (2,), default=None
        Initial estimates of location and shape from which to run the c_step
        procedure:
        - initial_estimates[0]: an initial location estimate
        - initial_estimates[1]: an initial covariance estimate

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Verbose mode.

    cov_computation_method : callable,             default=:func:`sklearn.covariance.empirical_covariance`
        The function which will be used to compute the covariance.
        Must return array of shape (n_features, n_features).

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines the pseudo random number generator for shuffling the data.
        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    Returns
    -------
    location : ndarray of shape (n_features,)

        Robust covariance estimates.

        A mask for the `n_support` observations whose scatter matrix has
        minimum determinant.

    '''Finds the best pure subset of observations to compute MCD from it.

    The purpose of this function is to find the best sets of n_support
    observations with respect to a minimization of their covariance
    matrix determinant. Equivalently, it removes n_samples-n_support
    observations to construct what we call a pure data set (i.e. not
    containing outliers). The list of the observations of the pure
    data set is referred to as the `support`.

    Starting from a random support, the pure data set is found by the
    c_step procedure introduced by Rousseeuw and Van Driessen in
    [RV]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Data (sub)set in which we look for the n_support purest observations.

    n_support : int
        The number of samples the pure data set must contain.
        This parameter must be in the range `[(n + p + 1)/2] < n_support < n`.

    n_trials : int or tuple of shape (2,)
        Number of different initial sets of observations from which to
        run the algorithm. This parameter should be a strictly positive
        integer.
        Instead of giving a number of trials to perform, one can provide a
        list of initial estimates that will be used to iteratively run
        c_step procedures. In this case:
        - n_trials[0]: array-like, shape (n_trials, n_features)
          is the list of `n_trials` initial location estimates
        - n_trials[1]: array-like, shape (n_trials, n_features, n_features)
          is the list of `n_trials` initial covariances estimates

    select : int, default=1
        Number of best candidates results to return. This parameter must be
        a strictly positive integer.

    n_iter : int, default=30
        Maximum number of iterations for the c_step procedure.
        (2 is enough to be close to the final solution. "Never" exceeds 20).
        This parameter must be a strictly positive integer.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Control the output verbosity.

    cov_computation_method : callable,             default=:func:`sklearn.covariance.empirical_covariance`
        The function which will be used to compute the covariance.
        Must return an array of shape (n_features, n_features).

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines the pseudo random number generator for shuffling the data.
        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.

    support : ndarray of shape (n_samples,), dtype=bool
        A mask of the observations that have been used to compute

    Notes
    -----
    The FastMCD algorithm has been introduced by Rousseuw and Van Driessen
    in "A Fast Algorithm for the Minimum Covariance Determinant Estimator,
    1999, American Statistical Association and the American Society
    for Quality, TECHNOMETRICS".
    The principle is to compute robust estimates and random subsets before
    pooling them into a larger subsets, and finally into the full data set.
    Depending on the size of the initial sample, we have one, two or three
    such computation levels.

    Note that only raw estimates are returned. If one is interested in
    the correction and reweighting steps described in [RouseeuwVan]_,
    see the MinCovDet object.

    The Minimum Covariance Determinant covariance estimator is to be applied
    on Gaussian-distributed data, but could still be relevant on data
    drawn from a unimodal, symmetric distribution. It is not meant to be used
    with multi-modal data (the algorithm used to fit a MinCovDet object is

    One should consider projection pursuit methods to deal with multi-modal
    datasets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    store_precision : bool, default=True
        Specify if the estimated precision is stored.

    assume_centered : bool, default=False
        If True, the support of the robust location and the covariance
        estimates is computed, and a covariance estimate is recomputed from
        it, without centering the data.
        Useful to work with data whose mean is significantly equal to
        zero but is not exactly zero.
        If False, the robust location and covariance are directly computed

    support_fraction : float, default=None
        The proportion of points to be included in the support of the raw
