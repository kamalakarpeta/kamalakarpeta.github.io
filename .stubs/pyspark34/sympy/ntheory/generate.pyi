class primepi(Function):
    """ Represents the prime counting function pi(n) = the number
        of prime numbers less than or equal to n.

        Algorithm Description:

        In sieve method, we remove all multiples of prime p
        except p itself.

        Let phi(i,j) be the number of integers 2 <= k <= i
        which remain after sieving from primes less than
        or equal to j.
        Clearly, pi(n) = phi(n, sqrt(n))

        If j is not a prime,
        phi(i,j) = phi(i, j - 1)

        if j is a prime,
        We remove all numbers(except j) whose
        smallest prime factor is j.

        Let $x= j \\times a$ be such a number, where $2 \\le a \\le i / j$
        Now, after sieving from primes $\\le j - 1$,
        a must remain
        (because x, and hence a has no prime factor $\\le j - 1$)
        Clearly, there are phi(i / j, j - 1) such a
        which remain on sieving from primes $\\le j - 1$

        Now, if a is a prime less than equal to j - 1,
        $x= j \\times a$ has smallest prime factor = a, and
        has already been removed(by sieving from a).
        So, we do not need to remove it again.
        (Note: there will be pi(j - 1) such x)

        Thus, number of x, that will be removed are:
        phi(i / j, j - 1) - phi(j - 1, j - 1)
        (Note that pi(j - 1) = phi(j - 1, j - 1))

        $\\Rightarrow$ phi(i,j) = phi(i, j - 1) - phi(i / j, j - 1) + phi(j - 1, j - 1)

        So,following recursion is used and implemented as dp:

        phi(a, b) = phi(a, b - 1), if b is not a prime
        phi(a, b) = phi(a, b-1)-phi(a / b, b-1) + phi(b-1, b-1), if b is prime

        Clearly a is always of the form floor(n / k),
        which can take at most $2\\sqrt{n}$ values.
        Two arrays arr1,arr2 are maintained
        arr1[i] = phi(i, j),
        arr2[i] = phi(n // i, j)

        Finally the answer is arr2[1]

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import primepi, prime, prevprime, isprime
        >>> primepi(25)
        9

        So there are 9 primes less than or equal to 25. Is 25 prime?

        >>> isprime(25)
        False

        It is not. So the first prime less than 25 must be the
        9th prime:

        >>> prevprime(25) == prime(9)
        True

        Notes
        =====

        Some famous conjectures about the occurrence of primes in a given
        range are [1]:

        - Twin primes: though often not, the following will give 2 primes
                    an infinite number of times:
                        primerange(6*n - 1, 6*n + 2)
        - Legendre's: the following always yields at least one prime
                        primerange(n**2, (n+1)**2+1)
        - Bertrand's (proven): there is always a prime in the range
                        primerange(n, 2*n)
        - Brocard's: there are at least four primes in the range
                        primerange(prime(n)**2, prime(n+1)**2)

        The average gap between primes is log(n) [2]; the gap between
        primes can be arbitrarily large since sequences of composite
        numbers are arbitrarily large, e.g. the numbers in the sequence
        n! + 2, n! + 3 ... n! + n are all composite.

def primorial(n, nth: bool = True):
    """
    Returns the product of the first n primes (default) or
    the primes less than or equal to n (when ``nth=False``).

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.ntheory.generate import primorial, primerange
    >>> from sympy import factorint, Mul, primefactors, sqrt

    >>> primorial(sqrt(101), nth=False)

    One can argue that the primes are infinite since if you take
    a set of primes and multiply them together (e.g. the primorial) and
    then add or subtract 1, the result cannot be divided by any of the
    original factors, hence either 1 or more new primes must divide this
    product of primes.

    In this case, the number itself is a new prime:

    >>> factorint(primorial(4) + 1)
    {211: 1}

    In this case two new primes are the factors:

    >>> factorint(primorial(4) - 1)
    {11: 1, 19: 1}

    Here, some primes smaller and larger than the primes multiplied together
    are obtained:

    >>> p = list(primerange(10, 20))
    >>> sorted(set(primefactors(Mul(*p) + 1)).difference(set(p)))
    [2, 5, 31, 149]
