    The algorithm is based on the following result:

        \\binom{n}{k_1, \\ldots, k_m} =
        \\frac{k_1 + 1}{n - k_1} \\sum_{i=2}^m \\binom{n}{k_1 + 1, \\ldots, k_i - 1, \\ldots}

    This routine has been optimized for `m` large with respect to `n` by taking
    advantage of the fact that when the monomial tuples `t` are stripped of
    zeros, their coefficient is the same as that of the monomial tuples from
    ``multinomial_coefficients(n, n)``. Therefore, the latter coefficients are
    precomputed to save memory and time.
