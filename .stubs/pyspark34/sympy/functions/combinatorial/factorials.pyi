    """Implementation of factorial function over nonnegative integers.
       By convention (consistent with the gamma function and the binomial
       coefficients), factorial of a negative integer is complex infinity.

       The factorial is very important in combinatorics where it gives
       the number of ways in which `n` objects can be permuted. It also
       arises in calculus, probability, number theory, etc.

       There is strict relation of factorial with gamma function. In
       fact `n! = gamma(n+1)` for nonnegative integers. Rewrite of this
       kind is very useful in case of combinatorial simplification.

       Computation of the factorial is done using two algorithms. For
       small arguments a precomputed look up table is used. However for bigger
       input algorithm Prime-Swing is used. It is the fastest algorithm
       known and computes `n!` via prime factorization of special class
       of numbers, called here the 'Swing Numbers'.

    First, in a strict combinatorial sense it defines the
    number of ways we can choose `k` elements from a set of
    `n` elements. In this case both arguments are nonnegative
    integers and binomial is computed using an efficient
    algorithm based on prime factorization.

    The other definition is generalization for arbitrary `n`,
    however `k` must also be nonnegative. This case is very
    useful when evaluating summations.

    For the sake of convenience, for negative integer `k` this function
    will return zero no matter the other argument.

    To expand the binomial when `n` is a symbol, use either
    ``expand_func()`` or ``expand(func=True)``. The former will keep
    the polynomial in factored form while the latter will expand the
    polynomial itself. See examples for details.
