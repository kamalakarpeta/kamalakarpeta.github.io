    Expression representing multiplication operation for algebraic field.

    .. deprecated:: 1.7

       Using arguments that aren't subclasses of :class:`~.Expr` in core
       operators (:class:`~.Mul`, :class:`~.Add`, and :class:`~.Pow`) is
       deprecated. See :ref:`non-expr-args-deprecated` for details.

    Every argument of ``Mul()`` must be ``Expr``. Infix operator ``*``
    on most scalar objects in SymPy calls this class.

    Another use of ``Mul()`` is to represent the structure of abstract
    multiplication so that its arguments can be substituted to return
    different class. Refer to examples section for this.

    ``Mul()`` evaluates the argument unless ``evaluate=False`` is passed.
    The evaluation logic includes:

    1. Flattening
        ``Mul(x, Mul(y, z))`` -> ``Mul(x, y, z)``

    2. Identity removing
        ``Mul(x, 1, y)`` -> ``Mul(x, y)``

    3. Exponent collecting by ``.as_base_exp()``
        ``Mul(x, x**2)`` -> ``Pow(x, 3)``

    4. Term sorting
        ``Mul(y, x, 2)`` -> ``Mul(2, x, y)``

    Since multiplication can be vector space operation, arguments may
    have the different :obj:`sympy.core.kind.Kind()`. Kind of the
    resulting object is automatically inferred.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Mul
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> Mul(x, 1)
    x
    >>> Mul(x, x)
    x**2

    If ``evaluate=False`` is passed, result is not evaluated.

    >>> Mul(1, 2, evaluate=False)
    1*2
    >>> Mul(x, x, evaluate=False)
    x*x

    ``Mul()`` also represents the general structure of multiplication
    operation.

    >>> from sympy import MatrixSymbol
    >>> A = MatrixSymbol('A', 2,2)
    >>> expr = Mul(x,y).subs({y:A})
    >>> expr
    x*A
    >>> type(expr)

        Notes
        =====
            * In an expression like ``a*b*c``, Python process this through SymPy
              as ``Mul(Mul(a, b), c)``. This can have undesirable consequences.

              -  Sometimes terms are not combined as one would like:

                >>> from sympy import Mul, sqrt
                >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
                >>> 2*(x + 1) # this is the 2-arg Mul behavior

                2*y*(x + 1)

                y*(2*x + 2)
                >>> Mul(2, x + 1, y) # all 3 args simultaneously processed
                2*y*(x + 1)
                >>> 2*((x + 1)*y) # parentheses can control this behavior
                2*y*(x + 1)

                Powers with compound bases may not find a single base to
                combine with unless all arguments are processed at once.
                Post-processing may be necessary in such cases.
                {c.f. https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/5728}

                >>> a = sqrt(x*sqrt(y))
                >>> a**3
                (x*sqrt(y))**(3/2)
                >>> Mul(a,a,a)
                (x*sqrt(y))**(3/2)
                >>> a*a*a
                x*sqrt(y)*sqrt(x*sqrt(y))
                >>> _.subs(a.base, z).subs(z, a.base)
                (x*sqrt(y))**(3/2)

              -  If more than two terms are being multiplied then all the
                 previous terms will be re-processed for each new argument.
                 So if each of ``a``, ``b`` and ``c`` were :class:`Mul`
                 expression, then ``a*b*c`` (or building up the product
                 with ``*=``) will process all the arguments of ``a`` and
                 ``b`` twice: once when ``a*b`` is computed and again when
                 ``c`` is multiplied.

                 Using ``Mul(a, b, c)`` will process all arguments once.

            * The results of Mul are cached according to arguments, so flatten
              will only be called once for ``Mul(a, b, c)``. If you can
              structure a calculation so the arguments are most likely to be
              repeats then this can save time in computing the answer. For
              example, say you had a Mul, M, that you wished to divide by ``d[i]``
              and multiply by ``n[i]`` and you suspect there are many repeats
              in ``n``. It would be better to compute ``M*n[i]/d[i]`` rather
              than ``M/d[i]*n[i]`` since every time n[i] is a repeat, the
              product, ``M*n[i]`` will be returned without flattening -- the
              cached value will be returned. If you divide by the ``d[i]``
              first (and those are more unique than the ``n[i]``) then that will
              create a new Mul, ``M/d[i]`` the args of which will be traversed
              again when it is multiplied by ``n[i]``.

              {c.f. https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/5706}

              This consideration is moot if the cache is turned off.

            NB
            --
              The validity of the above notes depends on the implementation
              details of Mul and flatten which may change at any time. Therefore,
              you should only consider them when your code is highly performance
              sensitive.

              Removal of 1 from the sequence is already handled by AssocOp.__new__.
