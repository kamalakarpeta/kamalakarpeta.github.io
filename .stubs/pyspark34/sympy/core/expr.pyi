class Expr(Basic, EvalfMixin):

    Base class for algebraic expressions.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Everything that requires arithmetic operations to be defined
    should subclass this class, instead of Basic (which should be
    used only for argument storage and expression manipulation, i.e.
    pattern matching, substitutions, etc).

    If you want to override the comparisons of expressions:
    Should use _eval_is_ge for inequality, or _eval_is_eq, with multiple dispatch.
    _eval_is_ge return true if x >= y, false if x < y, and None if the two types
    are not comparable or the comparison is indeterminate

        """Return True if self is constant, False if not, or None if
        the constancy could not be determined conclusively.

        Explanation
        ===========

        If an expression has no free symbols then it is a constant. If
        there are free symbols it is possible that the expression is a
        constant, perhaps (but not necessarily) zero. To test such
        expressions, a few strategies are tried:

        1) numerical evaluation at two random points. If two such evaluations
        give two different values and the values have a precision greater than
        1 then self is not constant. If the evaluations agree or could not be
        obtained with any precision, no decision is made. The numerical testing
        is done only if ``wrt`` is different than the free symbols.

        2) differentiation with respect to variables in 'wrt' (or all free
        symbols if omitted) to see if the expression is constant or not. This
        will not always lead to an expression that is zero even though an
        expression is constant (see added test in test_expr.py). If
        all derivatives are zero then self is constant with respect to the
        given symbols.

        3) finding out zeros of denominator expression with free_symbols.
        It will not be constant if there are zeros. It gives more negative
        answers for expression that are not constant.

        If neither evaluation nor differentiation can prove the expression is
        constant, None is returned unless two numerical values happened to be
        the same and the flag ``failing_number`` is True -- in that case the
        numerical value will be returned.

        If flag simplify=False is passed, self will not be simplified;
        the default is True since self should be simplified before testing.

        from the following:

        >>> (x + z*(x + x*y)).coeff(x)
        1

        If such factoring is desired, factor_terms can be used first:

        >>> from sympy import factor_terms

        1
        >>> (3*n).coeff(n)
        3

        1 + m
        >>> (n*m + m*n*m).coeff(n, right=True) # = (1 + m)*n*m
        m

        If there is more than one possible coefficient 0 is returned:

        >>> (n*m + m*n).coeff(n)

        Returns the series expansion of "self" around the point ``x = x0``
        with respect to ``x`` up to ``O((x - x0)**n, x, x0)`` (default n is 6).

        If ``x=None`` and ``self`` is univariate, the univariate symbol will
        be supplied, otherwise an error will be raised.

        Parameters
        ==========

        expr : Expression
               The expression whose series is to be expanded.

        x : Symbol
            It is the variable of the expression to be calculated.

        x0 : Value
             The value around which ``x`` is calculated. Can be any value
             from ``-oo`` to ``oo``.

        n : Value
            The value used to represent the order in terms of ``x**n``,
            up to which the series is to be expanded.

        dir : String, optional
              The series-expansion can be bi-directional. If ``dir="+"``,
              then (x->x0+). If ``dir="-", then (x->x0-). For infinite
              ``x0`` (``oo`` or ``-oo``), the ``dir`` argument is determined
              from the direction of the infinity (i.e., ``dir="-"`` for
              ``oo``).

        logx : optional
               It is used to replace any log(x) in the returned series with a
               symbolic value rather than evaluating the actual value.

        cdir : optional
               It stands for complex direction, and indicates the direction
               from which the expansion needs to be evaluated.

        >>> e.series(x, n=2)
        cos(exp(y)) - x*sin(exp(y)) + O(x**2)

        If ``n=None`` then a generator of the series terms will be returned.

        >>> term=cos(x).series(n=None)
        >>> [next(term) for i in range(2)]
        [1, -x**2/2]

        For ``dir=+`` (default) the series is calculated from the right and
        for ``dir=-`` the series from the left. For smooth functions this
        flag will not alter the results.

        (x - 2)**3*(1/3 + 4*tan(2)**2/3 + tan(2)**4) + (x - 2)**4*(tan(2)**5 +

        Notes
        =====

        This algorithm is directly induced from the limit computational algorithm provided by Gruntz.
        It majorly uses the mrv and rewrite sub-routines. The overall idea of this algorithm is first
        to look for the most rapidly varying subexpression w of a given expression f and then expands f
        in a series in w. Then same thing is recursively done on the leading coefficient
        till we get constant coefficients.

        If the most rapidly varying subexpression of a given expression f is f itself,
        the algorithm tries to find a normalised representation of the mrv set and rewrites f
        using this normalised representation.

        If the expansion contains an order term, it will be either ``O(x ** (-n))`` or ``O(w ** (-n))``
        where ``w`` belongs to the most rapidly varying expression of ``self``.

        If x is given, x0 is 0, dir=\'+\', and self has x, then _eval_nseries is

        then builds up the final series just by "cross-multiplying" everything
        out.

        The optional ``logx`` parameter can be used to replace any log(x) in the
        returned series with a symbolic value to avoid evaluating log(x) at 0. A
        symbol to use in place of log(x) should be provided.

        Advantage -- it\'s fast, because we do not have to determine how many
        terms we need to calculate in advance.

        Disadvantage -- you may end up with less terms than you may have
        expected, but the O(x**n) term appended will always be correct and
        so the result, though perhaps shorter, will also be correct.

        If any of those assumptions is not met, this is treated like a

        Handling of the ``logx`` parameter --- in the following example the

        at -oo (the limit of log(x) as x approaches 0):

        The Python ``round`` function uses the SymPy ``round`` method so it
        will always return a SymPy number (not a Python float or int):
