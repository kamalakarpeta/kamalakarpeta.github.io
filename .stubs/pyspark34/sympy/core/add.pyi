class Add(Expr, AssocOp):
    """
    Expression representing addition operation for algebraic group.

    .. deprecated:: 1.7

       Using arguments that aren't subclasses of :class:`~.Expr` in core
       operators (:class:`~.Mul`, :class:`~.Add`, and :class:`~.Pow`) is
       deprecated. See :ref:`non-expr-args-deprecated` for details.

    Every argument of ``Add()`` must be ``Expr``. Infix operator ``+``
    on most scalar objects in SymPy calls this class.

    Another use of ``Add()`` is to represent the structure of abstract
    addition so that its arguments can be substituted to return different
    class. Refer to examples section for this.

    ``Add()`` evaluates the argument unless ``evaluate=False`` is passed.
    The evaluation logic includes:

    1. Flattening
        ``Add(x, Add(y, z))`` -> ``Add(x, y, z)``

    2. Identity removing
        ``Add(x, 0, y)`` -> ``Add(x, y)``

    3. Coefficient collecting by ``.as_coeff_Mul()``
        ``Add(x, 2*x)`` -> ``Mul(3, x)``

    4. Term sorting
        ``Add(y, x, 2)`` -> ``Add(2, x, y)``

    If no argument is passed, identity element 0 is returned. If single
    element is passed, that element is returned.

    Note that ``Add(*args)`` is more efficient than ``sum(args)`` because
    it flattens the arguments. ``sum(a, b, c, ...)`` recursively adds the
    arguments as ``a + (b + (c + ...))``, which has quadratic complexity.
    On the other hand, ``Add(a, b, c, d)`` does not assume nested
    structure, making the complexity linear.

    Since addition is group operation, every argument should have the
    same :obj:`sympy.core.kind.Kind()`.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Add, I
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> Add(x, 1)
    x + 1
    >>> Add(x, x)
    2*x
    >>> 2*x**2 + 3*x + I*y + 2*y + 2*x/5 + 1.0*y + 1
    2*x**2 + 17*x/5 + 3.0*y + I*y + 1

    If ``evaluate=False`` is passed, result is not evaluated.

    >>> Add(1, 2, evaluate=False)
    1 + 2
    >>> Add(x, x, evaluate=False)
    x + x

    ``Add()`` also represents the general structure of addition operation.

    >>> from sympy import MatrixSymbol
    >>> A,B = MatrixSymbol('A', 2,2), MatrixSymbol('B', 2,2)
    >>> expr = Add(x,y).subs({x:A, y:B})
    >>> expr
    A + B
    >>> type(expr)
    <class 'sympy.matrices.expressions.matadd.MatAdd'>

    Note that the printers do not display in args order.

    >>> Add(x, 1)
    x + 1
    >>> Add(x, 1).args
    (1, x)
