def rational_algorithm(f, x, k, order: int = 4, full: bool = False):
    """
    Rational algorithm for computing
    formula of coefficients of Formal Power Series
    of a function.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Applicable when f(x) or some derivative of f(x)
    is a rational function in x.

    :func:`rational_algorithm` uses :func:`~.apart` function for partial fraction
    decomposition. :func:`~.apart` by default uses 'undetermined coefficients
    method'. By setting ``full=True``, 'Bronstein's algorithm' can be used
    instead.

    Looks for derivative of a function up to 4'th order (by default).
    This can be overridden using order option.

    Parameters
    ==========

    x : Symbol
    order : int, optional
        Order of the derivative of ``f``, Default is 4.
    full : bool

    Returns
    =======

    formula : Expr
    ind : Expr
        Independent terms.
    order : int
    full : bool

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import log, atan
    >>> from sympy.series.formal import rational_algorithm as ra
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, k

    >>> ra(1 / (1 - x), x, k)
    (1, 0, 0)
    >>> ra(log(1 + x), x, k)
    (-1/((-1)**k*k), 0, 1)

    >>> ra(atan(x), x, k, full=True)
    ((-I/(2*(-I)**k) + I/(2*I**k))/k, 0, 1)

    Notes
    =====

    By setting ``full=True``, range of admissible functions to be solved using
    ``rational_algorithm`` can be increased. This option should be used
    carefully as it can significantly slow down the computation as ``doit`` is
    performed on the :class:`~.RootSum` object returned by the :func:`~.apart`
    function. Use ``full=False`` whenever possible.

    instead of a point by point logic.

    There is a single difference between a :obj:`FormalPowerSeries` object and a
    :obj:`FormalPowerSeriesInverse` object. The coefficient sequence contains the
    generic sequence which is to be multiplied by a custom ``bell_seq`` finite sequence.
    The finite terms will then be added up to get the final terms.

    """
    Generates Formal Power Series of ``f``.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Returns the formal series expansion of ``f`` around ``x = x0``
    with respect to ``x`` in the form of a ``FormalPowerSeries`` object.

    Formal Power Series is represented using an explicit formula
    computed using different algorithms.

    See :func:`compute_fps` for the more details regarding the computation
    of formula.

    Parameters
    ==========

    x : Symbol, optional
        If x is None and ``f`` is univariate, the univariate symbols will be
        supplied, otherwise an error will be raised.
    x0 : number, optional
        Point to perform series expansion about. Default is 0.
    dir : {1, -1, '+', '-'}, optional
        If dir is 1 or '+' the series is calculated from the right and
        for -1 or '-' the series is calculated from the left. For smooth
        functions this flag will not alter the results. Default is 1.
    hyper : {True, False}, optional
        Set hyper to False to skip the hypergeometric algorithm.
        By default it is set to False.
    order : int, optional
        Order of the derivative of ``f``, Default is 4.
    rational : {True, False}, optional
        Set rational to False to skip rational algorithm. By default it is set
        to True.
    full : {True, False}, optional
        Set full to True to increase the range of rational algorithm.
        See :func:`rational_algorithm` for details. By default it is set to
        False.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import fps, ln, atan, sin
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, n

    Rational Functions

    >>> fps(ln(1 + x)).truncate()
    x - x**2/2 + x**3/3 - x**4/4 + x**5/5 + O(x**6)

    >>> fps(atan(x), full=True).truncate()
    x - x**3/3 + x**5/5 + O(x**6)

    Symbolic Functions

    >>> fps(x**n*sin(x**2), x).truncate(8)
    -x**(n + 6)/6 + x**(n + 2) + O(x**(n + 8))
