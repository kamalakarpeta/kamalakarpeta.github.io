def hermite_normal_form(A, *, D: Incomplete | None = None, check_rank: bool = False):
    """
    Compute the Hermite Normal Form of a Matrix *A* of integers.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Matrix
    >>> from sympy.matrices.normalforms import hermite_normal_form
    >>> m = Matrix([[12, 6, 4], [3, 9, 6], [2, 16, 14]])
    >>> print(hermite_normal_form(m))
    Matrix([[10, 0, 2], [0, 15, 3], [0, 0, 2]])

    Parameters
    ==========

    A : $m \\times n$ ``Matrix`` of integers.

    D : int, optional
        Let $W$ be the HNF of *A*. If known in advance, a positive integer *D*
        being any multiple of $\\det(W)$ may be provided. In this case, if *A*
        also has rank $m$, then we may use an alternative algorithm that works
        mod *D* in order to prevent coefficient explosion.

    check_rank : boolean, optional (default=False)
        The basic assumption is that, if you pass a value for *D*, then
        you already believe that *A* has rank $m$, so we do not waste time
        checking it for you. If you do want this to be checked (and the
        ordinary, non-modulo *D* algorithm to be used if the check fails), then
        set *check_rank* to ``True``.

    Returns
    =======

    ``Matrix``
        The HNF of matrix *A*.

    Raises
    ======

    DMDomainError
        If the domain of the matrix is not :ref:`ZZ`.

    DMShapeError
        If the mod *D* algorithm is used but the matrix has more rows than
        columns.
