def select(shape, args, dataset: Incomplete | None = None):
    ''' High-level routine to generate a selection from arbitrary arguments
    to __getitem__.  The arguments should be the following:

    shape
        Shape of the "source" dataspace.

    args
        Either a single argument or a tuple of arguments.  See below for
        supported classes of argument.

    dataset
        A h5py.Dataset instance representing the source dataset.

    Argument classes:

    Single Selection instance
        Returns the argument.

    numpy.ndarray
        Must be a boolean mask.  Returns a PointSelection instance.

    RegionReference
        Returns a Selection instance.

    Indices, slices, ellipses, MultiBlockSlices only
        Returns a SimpleSelection instance

    Indices, slices, ellipses, lists or boolean index arrays
        Returns a FancySelection instance.

class Selection:
    '''
        Base class for HDF5 dataspace selections.  Subclasses support the
        "selection protocol", which means they have at least the following
        members:

        __init__(shape)   => Create a new selection on "shape"-tuple
        __getitem__(args) => Perform a selection with the range specified.
                             What args are allowed depends on the
                             particular subclass in use.

        id (read-only) =>      h5py.h5s.SpaceID instance
        shape (read-only) =>   The shape of the dataspace.
        mshape  (read-only) => The shape of the selection region.
                               Not guaranteed to fit within "shape", although
                               the total number of points is less than
                               product(shape).
        nselect (read-only) => Number of selected points.  Always equal to
                               product(mshape).

        broadcast(target_shape) => Return an iterable which yields dataspaces
                                   for read, based on target_shape.

        The base class represents "unshaped" selections (1-D).
