    This is done for efficiency reasons and to make it less likely to encounter
    memory leaks with badly written WSGI middlewares.  The downside is that if
    you are using streamed responses, the generator cannot access request bound
    information any more.

    This function however can help you keep the context around for longer::

        from flask import stream_with_context, request, Response

        @app.route('/stream')

            return Response(generate())

    Alternatively it can also be used around a specific generator::

        from flask import stream_with_context, request, Response

    """Sometimes it is necessary to set additional headers in a view.  Because
    views do not have to return response objects but can return a value that
    is converted into a response object by Flask itself, it becomes tricky to
    add headers to it.  This function can be called instead of using a return
    and you will get a response object which you can use to attach headers.

    If view looked like this and you want to add a new header::

        def index():
            return render_template('index.html', foo=42)

    You can now do something like this::

            response.headers['X-Parachutes'] = 'parachutes are cool'

    This function accepts the very same arguments you can return from a
    view function.  This for example creates a response with a 404 error
    code::

        response = make_response(render_template('not_found.html'), 404)

    The other use case of this function is to force the return value of a
    view function into a response which is helpful with view
    decorators::

        response = make_response(view_function())
        response.headers['X-Parachutes'] = 'parachutes are cool'

    -   if no arguments are passed, it creates a new response argument
    -   if one argument is passed, :meth:`flask.Flask.make_response`
        is invoked with it.
    -   if more than one argument is passed, the arguments are passed

    The first argument can be a file path or a file-like object. Paths
    are preferred in most cases because Werkzeug can manage the file and
    get extra information from the path. Passing a file-like object
    requires that the file is opened in binary mode, and is mostly
    useful when building a file in memory with :class:`io.BytesIO`.

    Never pass file paths provided by a user. The path is assumed to be
    trusted, so a user could craft a path to access a file you didn't
    intend. Use :func:`send_from_directory` to safely serve
    user-requested paths from within a directory.

    If the WSGI server sets a ``file_wrapper`` in ``environ``, it is
    used, otherwise Werkzeug's built-in wrapper is used. Alternatively,
    if the HTTP server supports ``X-Sendfile``, configuring Flask with
    ``USE_X_SENDFILE = True`` will tell the server to send the given
    path, which is much more efficient than reading it in Python.

    :param path_or_file: The path to the file to send, relative to the

        save the file instead of displaying it.
    :param download_name: The default name browsers will use when saving
        the file. Defaults to the passed file name.
    :param conditional: Enable conditional and range responses based on
        request headers. Requires passing a file path and ``environ``.
    :param etag: Calculate an ETag for the file, which requires passing
        a file path. Can also be a string to use instead.
    :param last_modified: The last modified time to send for the file,
        in seconds. If not provided, it will try to detect it from the
        file path.
    :param max_age: How long the client should cache the file, in
        seconds. If set, ``Cache-Control`` will be ``public``, otherwise
        it will be ``no-cache`` to prefer conditional caching.
