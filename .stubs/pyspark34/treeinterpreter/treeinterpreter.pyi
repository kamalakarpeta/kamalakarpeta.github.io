def predict(model, X, joint_contribution: bool = False):
    """ Returns a triple (prediction, bias, feature_contributions), such
    that prediction ≈ bias + feature_contributions.
    Parameters
    ----------
    model : DecisionTreeRegressor, DecisionTreeClassifier,
        ExtraTreeRegressor, ExtraTreeClassifier,
        RandomForestRegressor, RandomForestClassifier,
        ExtraTreesRegressor, ExtraTreesClassifier
    Scikit-learn model on which the prediction should be decomposed.

    X : array-like, shape = (n_samples, n_features)
    Test samples.
    
    joint_contribution : boolean
    Specifies if contributions are given individually from each feature,
    or jointly over them

    Returns
    -------
    decomposed prediction : triple of
    * prediction, shape = (n_samples) for regression and (n_samples, n_classes)
        for classification
    * bias, shape = (n_samples) for regression and (n_samples, n_classes) for
        classification
    * contributions, If joint_contribution is False then returns and  array of 
        shape = (n_samples, n_features) for regression or
        shape = (n_samples, n_features, n_classes) for classification, denoting
        contribution from each feature.
        If joint_contribution is True, then shape is array of size n_samples,
        where each array element is a dict from a tuple of feature indices to
        to a value denoting the contribution from that feature tuple.
