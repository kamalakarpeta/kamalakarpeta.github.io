def partitioning(schema: Incomplete | None = None, field_names: Incomplete | None = None, flavor: Incomplete | None = None, dictionaries: Incomplete | None = None):
    '''
    Specify a partitioning scheme.

    The supported schemes include:

    - "DirectoryPartitioning": this scheme expects one segment in the file path
      for each field in the specified schema (all fields are required to be
      present). For example given schema<year:int16, month:int8> the path
      "/2009/11" would be parsed to ("year"_ == 2009 and "month"_ == 11).
    - "HivePartitioning": a scheme for "/$key=$value/" nested directories as
      found in Apache Hive. This is a multi-level, directory based partitioning
      scheme. Data is partitioned by static values of a particular column in
      the schema. Partition keys are represented in the form $key=$value in
      directory names. Field order is ignored, as are missing or unrecognized
      field names.
      For example, given schema<year:int16, month:int8, day:int8>, a possible
      path would be "/year=2009/month=11/day=15" (but the field order does not
      need to match).
    - "FilenamePartitioning": this scheme expects the partitions will have
      filenames containing the field values separated by "_".
      For example, given schema<year:int16, month:int8, day:int8>, a possible
      partition filename "2009_11_part-0.parquet" would be parsed
      to ("year"_ == 2009 and "month"_ == 11).

    Parameters
    ----------
    schema : pyarrow.Schema, default None
        The schema that describes the partitions present in the file path.
        If not specified, and `field_names` and/or `flavor` are specified,
        the schema will be inferred from the file path (and a
        PartitioningFactory is returned).
    field_names :  list of str, default None
        A list of strings (field names). If specified, the schema\'s types are
        inferred from the file paths (only valid for DirectoryPartitioning).
    flavor : str, default None
        The default is DirectoryPartitioning. Specify ``flavor="hive"`` for
        a HivePartitioning, and ``flavor="filename"`` for a
        FilenamePartitioning.
    dictionaries : dict[str, Array]
        If the type of any field of `schema` is a dictionary type, the
        corresponding entry of `dictionaries` must be an array containing
        every value which may be taken by the corresponding column or an
        error will be raised in parsing. Alternatively, pass `infer` to have
        Arrow discover the dictionary values, in which case a
        PartitioningFactory is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    Partitioning or PartitioningFactory
        The partioning scheme

    Examples
    --------

    Specify the Schema for paths like "/2009/June":

    >>> import pyarrow as pa
    >>> import pyarrow.dataset as ds
    >>> part = ds.partitioning(pa.schema([("year", pa.int16()),
    ...                                   ("month", pa.string())]))

    or let the types be inferred by only specifying the field names:

    >>> part =  ds.partitioning(field_names=["year", "month"])

    For paths like "/2009/June", the year will be inferred as int32 while month
    will be inferred as string.

    Specify a Schema with dictionary encoding, providing dictionary values:

    >>> part = ds.partitioning(
    ...     pa.schema([
    ...         ("year", pa.int16()),
    ...         ("month", pa.dictionary(pa.int8(), pa.string()))
    ...     ]),
    ...     dictionaries={
    ...         "month": pa.array(["January", "February", "March"]),
    ...     })

    Alternatively, specify a Schema with dictionary encoding, but have Arrow
    infer the dictionary values:

    >>> part = ds.partitioning(
    ...     pa.schema([
    ...         ("year", pa.int16()),
    ...         ("month", pa.dictionary(pa.int8(), pa.string()))
    ...     ]),
    ...     dictionaries="infer")

    Create a Hive scheme for a path like "/year=2009/month=11":

    >>> part = ds.partitioning(
    ...     pa.schema([("year", pa.int16()), ("month", pa.int8())]),
    ...     flavor="hive")

    A Hive scheme can also be discovered from the directory structure (and
    types will be inferred):

    >>> part = ds.partitioning(flavor="hive")

def parquet_dataset(metadata_path, schema: Incomplete | None = None, filesystem: Incomplete | None = None, format: Incomplete | None = None, partitioning: Incomplete | None = None, partition_base_dir: Incomplete | None = None):
    """
    Create a FileSystemDataset from a `_metadata` file created via
    `pyarrrow.parquet.write_metadata`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    metadata_path : path,
        Path pointing to a single file parquet metadata file
    schema : Schema, optional
        Optionally provide the Schema for the Dataset, in which case it will
        not be inferred from the source.
    filesystem : FileSystem or URI string, default None
        If a single path is given as source and filesystem is None, then the
        filesystem will be inferred from the path.
        If an URI string is passed, then a filesystem object is constructed
        using the URI's optional path component as a directory prefix. See the
        examples below.
        Note that the URIs on Windows must follow 'file:///C:...' or
        'file:/C:...' patterns.
    format : ParquetFileFormat
        An instance of a ParquetFileFormat if special options needs to be
        passed.
    partitioning : Partitioning, PartitioningFactory, str, list of str
        The partitioning scheme specified with the ``partitioning()``
        function. A flavor string can be used as shortcut, and with a list of
        field names a DirectionaryPartitioning will be inferred.
    partition_base_dir : str, optional
        For the purposes of applying the partitioning, paths will be
        stripped of the partition_base_dir. Files not matching the
        partition_base_dir prefix will be skipped for partitioning discovery.
        The ignored files will still be part of the Dataset, but will not
        have partition information.

    Returns
    -------
    FileSystemDataset
        The dataset corresponding to the given metadata

    '''
    Open a dataset.

    Datasets provides functionality to efficiently work with tabular,
    potentially larger than memory and multi-file dataset.

    - A unified interface for different sources, like Parquet and Feather
    - Discovery of sources (crawling directories, handle directory-based
      partitioned datasets, basic schema normalization)
    - Optimized reading with predicate pushdown (filtering rows), projection
      (selecting columns), parallel reading or fine-grained managing of tasks.

    Note that this is the high-level API, to have more control over the dataset
    construction use the low-level API classes (FileSystemDataset,
    FilesystemDatasetFactory, etc.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : path, list of paths, dataset, list of datasets, (list of) RecordBatch or Table, iterable of RecordBatch, RecordBatchReader, or URI
        Path pointing to a single file:
            Open a FileSystemDataset from a single file.
        Path pointing to a directory:
            The directory gets discovered recursively according to a
            partitioning scheme if given.
        List of file paths:
            Create a FileSystemDataset from explicitly given files. The files
            must be located on the same filesystem given by the filesystem
            parameter.
            Note that in contrary of construction from a single file, passing
            URIs as paths is not allowed.
        List of datasets:
            A nested UnionDataset gets constructed, it allows arbitrary
            composition of other datasets.
            Note that additional keyword arguments are not allowed.
        (List of) batches or tables, iterable of batches, or RecordBatchReader:
            Create an InMemoryDataset. If an iterable or empty list is given,
            a schema must also be given. If an iterable or RecordBatchReader
            is given, the resulting dataset can only be scanned once; further
            attempts will raise an error.
    schema : Schema, optional
        Optionally provide the Schema for the Dataset, in which case it will
        not be inferred from the source.
    format : FileFormat or str
        Currently "parquet", "ipc"/"arrow"/"feather", "csv", and "orc" are
        supported. For Feather, only version 2 files are supported.
    filesystem : FileSystem or URI string, default None
        If a single path is given as source and filesystem is None, then the
        filesystem will be inferred from the path.
        If an URI string is passed, then a filesystem object is constructed
        using the URI\'s optional path component as a directory prefix. See the
        examples below.
        Note that the URIs on Windows must follow \'file:///C:...\' or
        \'file:/C:...\' patterns.
    partitioning : Partitioning, PartitioningFactory, str, list of str
        The partitioning scheme specified with the ``partitioning()``
        function. A flavor string can be used as shortcut, and with a list of
        field names a DirectionaryPartitioning will be inferred.
    partition_base_dir : str, optional
        For the purposes of applying the partitioning, paths will be
        stripped of the partition_base_dir. Files not matching the
        partition_base_dir prefix will be skipped for partitioning discovery.
        The ignored files will still be part of the Dataset, but will not
        have partition information.
    exclude_invalid_files : bool, optional (default True)
        If True, invalid files will be excluded (file format specific check).
        This will incur IO for each files in a serial and single threaded
        fashion. Disabling this feature will skip the IO, but unsupported
        files may be present in the Dataset (resulting in an error at scan
        time).
    ignore_prefixes : list, optional
        Files matching any of these prefixes will be ignored by the
        discovery process. This is matched to the basename of a path.
        By default this is [\'.\', \'_\'].
        Note that discovery happens only if a directory is passed as source.

    Returns
    -------
    dataset : Dataset
        Either a FileSystemDataset or a UnionDataset depending on the source
        parameter.

    Examples
    --------

    n_legs: [[2,2,4,4,5,100]]
    animal: [["Flamingo","Parrot","Dog","Horse","Brittle stars","Centipede"]]

    Opening a dataset for a single directory:

    >>> ds.write_dataset(table, "partitioned_dataset", format="parquet",
    ...                  partitioning=[\'year\'])
    >>> dataset = ds.dataset("partitioned_dataset", format="parquet")
    >>> dataset.to_table()
    pyarrow.Table
    n_legs: int64
    animal: string
    ----
    n_legs: [[5],[2],[4,100],[2,4]]
    animal: [["Brittle stars"],["Flamingo"],...["Parrot","Horse"]]

    For a single directory from a S3 bucket:

    >>> ds.dataset("s3://mybucket/nyc-taxi/",
    ...            format="parquet") # doctest: +SKIP

    Opening a dataset from a list of relatives local paths:

    animal: string
    ----
    n_legs: [[5],[2],[4,100]]

    ...     \'part0/data.parquet\',
    ...     \'part1/data.parquet\',
    ...     \'part3/data.parquet\',
    ... ]
    >>> ds.dataset(paths, filesystem=\'file:///directory/prefix,
    ...            format=\'parquet\') # doctest: +SKIP

    Which is equivalent with:

    >>> fs = SubTreeFileSystem("/directory/prefix",
    ...                        LocalFileSystem()) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ds.dataset(paths, filesystem=fs, format=\'parquet\') # doctest: +SKIP

    Write a dataset to a given format and partitioning.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : Dataset, Table/RecordBatch, RecordBatchReader, list of Table/RecordBatch, or iterable of RecordBatch
        The data to write. This can be a Dataset instance or
        in-memory Arrow data. If an iterable is given, the schema must
        also be given.
    base_dir : str
        The root directory where to write the dataset.
    basename_template : str, optional
        A template string used to generate basenames of written data files.
        The token \'{i}\' will be replaced with an automatically incremented
        integer. If not specified, it defaults to
        "part-{i}." + format.default_extname
    format : FileFormat or str
        The format in which to write the dataset. Currently supported:
        "parquet", "ipc"/"arrow"/"feather", and "csv". If a FileSystemDataset
        is being written and `format` is not specified, it defaults to the
        same format as the specified FileSystemDataset. When writing a
        Table or RecordBatch, this keyword is required.
    partitioning : Partitioning or list[str], optional
        The partitioning scheme specified with the ``partitioning()``
        function or a list of field names. When providing a list of
        field names, you can use ``partitioning_flavor`` to drive which
        partitioning type should be used.
    partitioning_flavor : str, optional
        One of the partitioning flavors supported by
        ``pyarrow.dataset.partitioning``. If omitted will use the
        default of ``partitioning()`` which is directory partitioning.
    schema : Schema, optional
    filesystem : FileSystem, optional
    file_options : pyarrow.dataset.FileWriteOptions, optional
        FileFormat specific write options, created using the
        ``FileFormat.make_write_options()`` function.
    use_threads : bool, default True
        Write files in parallel. If enabled, then maximum parallelism will be
        used determined by the number of available CPU cores.
    max_partitions : int, default 1024
        Maximum number of partitions any batch may be written into.
    max_open_files : int, default 1024
        If greater than 0 then this will limit the maximum number of
        files that can be left open. If an attempt is made to open
        too many files then the least recently used file will be closed.
        If this setting is set too low you may end up fragmenting your
        data into many small files.
    max_rows_per_file : int, default 0
        Maximum number of rows per file. If greater than 0 then this will
        limit how many rows are placed in any single file. Otherwise there
        will be no limit and one file will be created in each output
        directory unless files need to be closed to respect max_open_files
    min_rows_per_group : int, default 0
        Minimum number of rows per group. When the value is greater than 0,
        the dataset writer will batch incoming data and only write the row
        groups to the disk when sufficient rows have accumulated.
    max_rows_per_group : int, default 1024 * 1024
        Maximum number of rows per group. If the value is greater than 0,
        then the dataset writer may split up large incoming batches into
        multiple row groups.  If this value is set, then min_rows_per_group
        should also be set. Otherwise it could end up with very small row
        groups.
    file_visitor : function
        If set, this function will be called with a WrittenFile instance
        for each file created during the call.  This object will have both
        a path attribute and a metadata attribute.

        The path attribute will be a string containing the path to
        the created file.

        The metadata attribute will be the parquet metadata of the file.
        This metadata will have the file path attribute set and can be used
        to build a _metadata file.  The metadata attribute will be None if
        the format is not parquet.

        Example visitor which simple collects the filenames created::

            visited_paths = []

            def file_visitor(written_file):
                visited_paths.append(written_file.path)
    existing_data_behavior : \'error\' | \'overwrite_or_ignore\' | \'delete_matching\'
        Controls how the dataset will handle data that already exists in
        the destination.  The default behavior (\'error\') is to raise an error
        if any data exists in the destination.

        \'overwrite_or_ignore\' will ignore any existing data and will
        overwrite files with the same name as an output file.  Other
        existing files will be ignored.  This behavior, in combination
        with a unique basename_template for each write, will allow for
        an append workflow.

        \'delete_matching\' is useful when you are writing a partitioned
        dataset.  The first time each partition directory is encountered
        the entire directory will be deleted.  This allows you to overwrite
        old partitions completely.
    create_dir : bool, default True
        If False, directories will not be created.  This can be useful for
        filesystems that do not require directories.
