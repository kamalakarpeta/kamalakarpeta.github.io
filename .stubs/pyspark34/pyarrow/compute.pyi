def cast(arr, target_type: Incomplete | None = None, safe: Incomplete | None = None, options: Incomplete | None = None, memory_pool: Incomplete | None = None):
    """
    Cast array values to another data type. Can also be invoked as an array
    instance method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : Array-like
    target_type : DataType or str
        Type to cast to
    safe : bool, default True
        Check for overflows or other unsafe conversions
    options : CastOptions, default None
        Additional checks pass by CastOptions
    memory_pool : MemoryPool, optional
        memory pool to use for allocations during function execution.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> import pyarrow as pa
    >>> arr = pa.array([datetime(2010, 1, 1), datetime(2015, 1, 1)])
    >>> arr.type
    TimestampType(timestamp[us])

    You can use ``pyarrow.DataType`` objects to specify the target type:

    >>> cast(arr, pa.timestamp('ms'))
    <pyarrow.lib.TimestampArray object at ...>
    [
      2010-01-01 00:00:00.000,
      2015-01-01 00:00:00.000
    ]

    >>> cast(arr, pa.timestamp('ms')).type
    TimestampType(timestamp[ms])

    Alternatively, it is also supported to use the string aliases for these
    types:

    >>> arr.cast('timestamp[ms]')
    <pyarrow.lib.TimestampArray object at ...>
    [
      2010-01-01 00:00:00.000,
      2015-01-01 00:00:00.000
    ]
    >>> arr.cast('timestamp[ms]').type
    TimestampType(timestamp[ms])

    Returns
    -------

        The cast result as a new Array

    ----------

    Select values (or records) from array- or table-like data given integer

    The result will be of the same type(s) as the input, with elements taken
    from the input array (or record batch / table fields) at the given
    indices. If an index is null then the corresponding value in the output
    will be null.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : Array, ChunkedArray, RecordBatch, or Table
    indices : Array, ChunkedArray
        Must be of integer type
    boundscheck : boolean, default True
        Whether to boundscheck the indices. If False and there is an out of
