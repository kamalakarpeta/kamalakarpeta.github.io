class AuthorizedSession(requests.Session):

    This class is used to perform requests to API endpoints that require

        from google.auth.transport.requests import AuthorizedSession

        authed_session = AuthorizedSession(credentials)

        response = authed_session.request(
            \'GET\', \'https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b\')


    The underlying :meth:`request` implementation handles adding the
    credentials\' headers to the request and refreshing credentials as needed.

    This class also supports mutual TLS via :meth:`configure_mtls_channel`
    method. In order to use this method, the `GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE`
    environment variable must be explicitly set to ``true``, otherwise it does
    nothing. Assume the environment is set to ``true``, the method behaves in the
    following manner:

    If client_cert_callback is provided, client certificate and private
    key are loaded using the callback; if client_cert_callback is None,
    application default SSL credentials will be used. Exceptions are raised if
    there are problems with the certificate, private key, or the loading process,
    so it should be called within a try/except block.

    First we set the environment variable to ``true``, then create an :class:`AuthorizedSession`
    instance and specify the endpoints::

        regular_endpoint = \'https://pubsub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{my_project_id}/topics\'
        mtls_endpoint = \'https://pubsub.mtls.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{my_project_id}/topics\'

        authed_session = AuthorizedSession(credentials)

    Now we can pass a callback to :meth:`configure_mtls_channel`::

        def my_cert_callback():
            # some code to load client cert bytes and private key bytes, both in
            # PEM format.
            some_code_to_load_client_cert_and_key()
            if loaded:
                return cert, key
            raise MyClientCertFailureException()

        # Always call configure_mtls_channel within a try/except block.
        try:
            authed_session.configure_mtls_channel(my_cert_callback)
        except:
            # handle exceptions.

        if authed_session.is_mtls:
            response = authed_session.request(\'GET\', mtls_endpoint)
        else:
            response = authed_session.request(\'GET\', regular_endpoint)


    You can alternatively use application default SSL credentials like this::

        try:
            authed_session.configure_mtls_channel()
        except:
            # handle exceptions.

    Args:
        credentials (google.auth.credentials.Credentials): The credentials to
            add to the request.
        refresh_status_codes (Sequence[int]): Which HTTP status codes indicate
            that credentials should be refreshed and the request should be
            retried.
        max_refresh_attempts (int): The maximum number of times to attempt to
            refresh the credentials and retry the request.
        refresh_timeout (Optional[int]): The timeout value in seconds for
            credential refresh HTTP requests.
        auth_request (google.auth.transport.requests.Request):
            (Optional) An instance of
            :class:`~google.auth.transport.requests.Request` used when
            refreshing credentials. If not passed,
            an instance of :class:`~google.auth.transport.requests.Request`
            is created.
        default_host (Optional[str]): A host like "pubsub.googleapis.com".

            account credentials.

                multiple requests are made under the hood.

                Mind that it is not guaranteed that the timeout error is raised
                at ``max_allowed_time``. It might take longer, for example, if
                an underlying request takes a lot of time, but the request
                itself does not timeout, e.g. if a large file is being
                transmitted. The timout error will be raised after such
                request completes.
