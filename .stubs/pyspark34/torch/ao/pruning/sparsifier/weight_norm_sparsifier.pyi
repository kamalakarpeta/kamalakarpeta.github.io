    '''Weight-Norm Sparsifier

    This sparsifier computes the norm of every sparse block and "zeroes-out" the
    ones with the lowest norm. The level of sparsity defines how many of the
    blocks is removed.

    This sparsifier is controlled by three variables:
    1. `sparsity_level` defines the number of *sparse blocks* that are zeroed-out
    2. `sparse_block_shape` defines the shape of the sparse blocks. Note that
        the sparse blocks originate at the zero-index of the tensor.
    3. `zeros_per_block` is the number of zeros that we are expecting in each
        sparse block. By default we assume that all elements within a block are
        zeroed-out. However, setting this variable sets the target number of
        zeros per block. The zeros within each block are chosen as the *smallest
        absolute values*.

    Args:

        sparsity_level: The target level of sparsity
        sparse_block_shape: The shape of a sparse block (see note below)
        zeros_per_block: Number of zeros in a sparse block
        norm: Norm to use. Could be either `int` or a callable.
            If `int`, only L1 and L2 are implemented.

    Note::
        The `sparse_block_shape` is tuple representing (block_ROWS, block_COLS),
        irrespective of what the rows / cols mean in the data tensor. That means,
        if you were to sparsify a weight tensor in the nn.Linear, which has a
        weight shape `(Cout, Cin)`, the `block_ROWS` would refer to the output
        channels, while the `block_COLS` would refer to the input channels.

    Note::
        All arguments to the WeightNormSparsifier constructor are "default"
        arguments and could be overriden by the configuration provided in the
        `prepare` step.
