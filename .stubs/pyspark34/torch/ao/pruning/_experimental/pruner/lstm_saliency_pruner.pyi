    Prune packed LSTM weights based on saliency.
    For each layer {k} inside a LSTM, we have two packed weight matrices
    - weight_ih_l{k}
    - weight_hh_l{k}

    These tensors pack the weights for the 4 linear layers together for efficency.

    [W_ii | W_if | W_ig | W_io]

    Pruning this tensor directly will lead to weights being misassigned when unpacked.
    To ensure that each packed linear layer is pruned the same amount:
        1. We split the packed weight into the 4 constitutient linear parts
        2. Update the mask for each individual piece using saliency individually

    This applies to both weight_ih_l{k} and weight_hh_l{k}.
