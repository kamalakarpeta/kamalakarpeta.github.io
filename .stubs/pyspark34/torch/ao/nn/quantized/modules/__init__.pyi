class Quantize(torch.nn.Module):
    """Quantizes an incoming tensor

    Args:
     `scale`: scale of the output Quantized Tensor
     `zero_point`: zero_point of output Quantized Tensor
     `dtype`: data type of output Quantized Tensor
     `factory_kwargs`: Dictionary of kwargs used for configuring initialization
         of internal buffers. Currently, `device` and `dtype` are supported.
         Example: `factory_kwargs={'device': 'cuda', 'dtype': torch.float64}`
         will initialize internal buffers as type `torch.float64` on the current CUDA device.
         Note that `dtype` only applies to floating-point buffers.

    Examples::
        >>> t = torch.tensor([[1., -1.], [1., -1.]])
        >>> scale, zero_point, dtype = 1.0, 2, torch.qint8
        >>> qm = Quantize(scale, zero_point, dtype)
