class Linear(nnq.Linear):
    """
    A dynamic quantized linear module with floating point tensor as inputs and outputs.
    We adopt the same interface as `torch.nn.Linear`, please see
    https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Linear for documentation.

    Similar to :class:`torch.nn.Linear`, attributes will be randomly
    initialized at module creation time and will be overwritten later

    Attributes:
        weight (Tensor): the non-learnable quantized weights of the module which are of
                         shape :math:`(\\text{out\\_features}, \\text{in\\_features})`.
        bias (Tensor): the non-learnable floating point bias of the module of shape
                       :math:`(\\text{out\\_features})`. If :attr:`bias` is ``True``,
                       the values are initialized to zero.

    Examples::

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> m = nn.quantized.dynamic.Linear(20, 30)
        >>> input = torch.randn(128, 20)
        >>> output = m(input)
        >>> print(output.size())
        torch.Size([128, 30])
