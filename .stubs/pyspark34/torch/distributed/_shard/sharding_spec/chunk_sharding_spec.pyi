class ChunkShardingSpec(ShardingSpec):
    """
    This is a type of PlacementSpec that defines the placement as being sharded
    across multiple devices. In particular, it represents sharding a Tensor
    along a single dimension into equal chunks (similar to :meth:`torch.chunk`).

    The semantics of how a tensor is partitioned is inline with
    :meth:`torch.chunk`, where ``dim`` in torch.chunk corresponds to the
    specified ``dim`` and ``chunks`` in torch.chunk is the number of elements
    in the placement specified.

    Args:
        dim (int or str):
            The dimension to shard on, could be an integer representing the
            dimension or a string in case of named tensors where dimensions are
            named. Note that named tensor support is not added yet.
        placement(List[Union[_remote_device, str]]):
            Specifies the placement of each shard of the Tensor. The size of
            the list represents the number of shards to be created. This could
            be a list of
            :class:`torch.distributed._remote_device`'s. This list
            could also contain a string which represents remote
            device as accepted by
            :class:`torch.distributed._remote_device`
