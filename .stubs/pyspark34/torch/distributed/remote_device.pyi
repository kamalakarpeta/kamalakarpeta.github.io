    '''
    Represents a device on a remote worker.

    Args:
        remote_device (str or torch.device): Represents a device on a remote worker.
            The string format should be one of the following:

                1. "<workername>/<device>", where the device field can be parsed as torch.device type.
                   E.g., "trainer0/cpu", "trainer0", "ps0/cuda:0".
                   In addition, the device field can be optional and the default value is "cpu".
                2. "rank:<rank>/<device>", where <rank> is the rank of the
                   process and device can be parsed as torch.device type.
                   E.g., "rank:0/cpu", "rank:0", "rank:0/cuda:0"
                3. <workername> and <rank> are optional and formats like "cpu"
                    and "cuda:1", just represent local devices.
