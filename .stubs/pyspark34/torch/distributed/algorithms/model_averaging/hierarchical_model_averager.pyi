class HierarchicalModelAverager(averagers.ModelAverager):
    '''
    Runs hierarchical model averaging (`hierarchical SGD <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12998.pdf>`_).
    Process groups of different sizes are organized in a hierarhicy, and they average parameters
    by using different periods concurrently after the warm-up stage.
    This is an extension of :class:`~torch.distributed.algorithms.model_averaging.averagers.PeriodicModelAverager`
    that supports `post-local SGD <https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07217>`_, which essentially only supports
    a two-level hierarchy: the intra-machine level and the global level, where the intra-machine
    level is usually embedded in :meth:`~torch.distributed.algorithms.ddp_comm_hooks.post_localSGD_hook`.
    Similarly, the process groups within this class do not have such an intra-machine process
    subgroup, which should be embedded by the post-local SGD communication hook instead.

    Args:
        period_group_size_dict: An ordered dict mapping keys of model averaging period to
                                process group size, used for initializing process groups of
                                different sizes in a hierarchy to average parameters concurrently.
                                Particularly, at each iteration, there will be at most a single
                                process group that runs averaging -- the period of such group should
                                have the largest period which the current step can be divided by.
                                For example, if the dict has three keys: 2, 4, and 8,
                                then this means totally three process groups will be created to
                                average parameters every 2, 4, and 8 iterations, respectively.
                                At the 4th iteration, only the second process group will run
                                averaging, because the first process group should be a
                                subset of the second process group, and no need to execute the first
                                process group redundantly.
                                On the other hand, the third process group can only be triggered
                                every 8 iterations, so it will not be triggered at the 4th iteration.
        warmup_steps (int): The number of warm-up steps. During this stage, model averaging is skipped.
        process_group (ProcessGroup, optional): The overall process group containing all the processes that runs model averaging.
                                                If ``None``, the default process group, which is created
                                                by :func:`torch.distributed.init_process_group`, will be used.
                                                (default: ``None``)

        >>> # Note that ``warmup_steps`` must be the same as ``start_localSGD_iter`` used in ``PostLocalSGDState``.
        >>> # In the first 100 steps, run global gradient averaging like normal DDP at every step.

    .. warning ::
        The last group size in the dict must be the size of the provided ``process_group``,
        which indicates model averaging at the highest level of the hierarchy.
        If ``process_group`` is not provided, then the last group size should be equal to the world size.

        `HierarchicalModelAverager` is experimental and subject to change.
