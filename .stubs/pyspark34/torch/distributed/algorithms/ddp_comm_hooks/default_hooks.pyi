def allreduce_hook(process_group: dist.ProcessGroup, bucket: dist.GradBucket) -> torch.futures.Future[torch.Tensor]:
    """
    This DDP communication hook just calls ``allreduce`` using ``GradBucket``
    tensors. Once gradient tensors are aggregated across all workers, its ``then``
    callback takes the mean and returns the result. If user registers this hook,
    DDP results is expected to be same as the case where no hook was registered.
    Hence, this won't change behavior of DDP and user can use this as a reference
    or modify this hook to log useful information or any other purposes while
    unaffecting DDP behavior.

    Example::
        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> ddp_model.register_comm_hook(process_group, allreduce_hook)

    This DDP communication hook implements a simple gradient compression
    approach that casts ``GradBucket`` tensor to half-precision floating-point format (``torch.float16``)
    and then divides it by the process group size.
    It allreduces those ``float16`` gradient tensors. Once compressed gradient
    tensors are allreduced, the chained callback ``decompress`` casts it back to the input data type (such as ``float32``).
