    """
    Modifies the given ``hook`` to overlap the :class:`ZeroRedundancyOptimizer`
    optimizer step with the :class:`DistributedDataParallel` backward pass,
    where the optimizer step computation begins after the last gradient bucket
    computation has finished.

    This approach overlaps the optimizer computation and communication with the
    backward communication. In particular, the backward computation proceeds
    contiguously, and the optimizer computation follows, overlapping with
    outstanding backward communication (i.e. all-reduces) and possibly other
    optimizer communication (i.e. broadcasts).

    This approach may be preferred over :meth:`hook_with_zero_step_interleaved`
    if communication is relatively slow compared to computation.

    Arguments:
        hook (Callable[[Any, dist.GradBucket], torch.futures.Future]): the hook
            to modify.
        ddp (DistributedDataParallel): the :class:`DistributedDataParallel`
            instance to use.
        zero (ZeroRedundancyOptimizer): the :class:`ZeroRedundancyOptimizer`
            instance to use.
        shard_buckets (bool): if ``True``, then the assignment of each
            :class:`DistributedDataParallel` bucket is partitioned across
            possibly multiple :class:`ZeroRedundancyOptimizer` instances (i.e.
            across possibly multiple ranks) to approximate uniformity; if
            ``False``, then each bucket is wholly assigned to a single
            :class:`ZeroRedundancyOptimizer` instance (i.e. to a single rank).

    Returns:
        The modified hook.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if ``zero`` was constructed with ``overlap_with_ddp=False``.
        RuntimeError: if using any backend other than NCCL/HCCL since currently
            Gloo may hang.

    .. warning::
        Given the way that overlapping :class:`DistributedDataParallel` with

        two or three training iterations do not perform parameter updates in
        the optimizer step, depending on if ``static_graph=False`` or
        ``static_graph=True``, respectively. This is because it needs
        information about the gradient bucketing strategy used by
        :class:`DistributedDataParallel`, which is not finalized until the

    This approach overlaps the optimizer computation and communication with the
    backward computation and communication. In particular, once a bucket's
    gradients have been computed, the optimizer computation using those
    gradients is launched (though the actual computation must wait for the
    bucket's all-reduce to complete). This yields an interleaving of all-
    reduces and broadcasts in the communication stream.
