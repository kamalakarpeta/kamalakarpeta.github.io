    """
    This DDP communication hook is used for running post-localSGD algorithm,
    by combining with a model averaging component (e.g.,
    :class:`~torch.distributed.algorithms.model_averaging.averagers.PeriodicModelAverager`)
    that runs after the optimizer step.

    Args:
        state (PostLocalSGDState): State information to run post-localSGD.
            Users mainly need to tune ``start_localSGD_iter`` to determine when to start local SGD.
        bucket (dist.GradBucket): Bucket that stores a 1D flattened gradient tensor that batches multiple per-variable tensors.
            Note that since DDP comm hook only supports single process single device mode,
            only exactly one tensor is stored in this bucket.

    Returns:
        Future handler of the communication, which updates the gradients in place.

    Example::
        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> state = PostLocalSGDState(process_group=process_group, subgroup=subgroup,
                                  start_localSGD_iter=10)
        >>> ddp_model.register_comm_hook(state, post_localSGD_hook)
        >>> # Also need to establish a model averaging module and run model averaging after ``optimizer.step()``.
        >>> # Please refer to the examples in ``torch.distributed.algorithms.model_averaging.averagers`` module.
