class Join:
    '''
    This class defines the generic join context manager, which allows custom
    hooks to be called after a process joins. These hooks should shadow the
    collective communications of non-joined processes to prevent hanging and
    erroring and to ensure algorithmic correctness. Refer to :class:`JoinHook`
    for details about the hook definition.

    .. warning::
        The context manager requires each participating :class:`Joinable` to
        call the method :meth:`notify_join_context()` before its own per-
        iteration collective communications to ensure correctness.

    .. warning::
        The context manager requires that all ``process_group`` attributes in
        the :class:`JoinHook` objects are the same. If there are multiple
        :class:`JoinHook` objects, then the ``device`` of the first is used.
        The process group and device information is used for checking for non-
        joined processes and for notifying processes to throw an exception if
        ``throw_on_early_termination`` is enabled, both of which using an all-
        reduce.

    Arguments:
        joinables (List[Joinable]): a list of the participating
            :class:`Joinable` s; their hooks are iterated over in the given
            order.

        enable (bool): a flag enabling uneven input detection; setting to
            ``False`` disables the context manager\'s functionality and should
            only be set when the user knows the inputs will not be uneven
            (default: ``True``).

        throw_on_early_termination (bool): a flag controlling whether to throw an
            exception upon detecting uneven inputs (default: ``False``).

    Example::

        >>> import os
        >>> import torch
        >>> import torch.distributed as dist
        >>> import torch.multiprocessing as mp
        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP

        >>>
        >>> # On each spawned worker
        >>> def worker(rank):
        >>>     dist.init_process_group("nccl", rank=rank, world_size=2)
        >>>     model = DDP(torch.nn.Linear(1, 1).to(rank), device_ids=[rank])
        >>>     optim = ZeRO(model.parameters(), torch.optim.Adam, lr=0.01)
        >>>     # Rank 1 gets one more input than rank 0
        >>>     inputs = [torch.tensor([1.]).to(rank) for _ in range(10 + rank)]

        >>>             loss.backward()
        >>>             optim.step()
