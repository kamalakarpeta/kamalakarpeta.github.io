def find_free_port():
    '''
    Finds a free port and binds a temporary socket to it so that
    the port can be "reserved" until used.

    .. note:: the returned socket must be closed before using the port,
              otherwise a ``address already in use`` error will happen.
              The socket should be held and closed as close to the
              consumer of the port as possible since otherwise, there
              is a greater chance of race-condition where a different
              process may see the port as being free and take it.

    Returns: a socket binded to the reserved free port

    Usage::

    sock = find_free_port()
    port = sock.getsockname()[1]
    sock.close()
    use_port(port)

class EtcdServer:
    '''
    .. note:: tested on etcd server v3.4.3

    Starts and stops a local standalone etcd server on a random free
    port. Useful for single node, multi-worker launches or testing,
    where a sidecar etcd server is more convenient than having to
    separately setup an etcd server.

    This class registers a termination handler to shutdown the etcd
    subprocess on exit. This termination handler is NOT a substitute for
    calling the ``stop()`` method.

    The following fallback mechanism is used to find the etcd binary:

    1. Uses env var TORCHELASTIC_ETCD_BINARY_PATH
    2. Uses ``<this file root>/bin/etcd`` if one exists
    3. Uses ``etcd`` from ``PATH``

    Usage
    ::

     server = EtcdServer("/usr/bin/etcd", 2379, "/tmp/default.etcd")
     server.start()
     client = server.get_client()
     # use client
     server.stop()

    Args:
        etcd_binary_path: path of etcd server binary (see above for fallback path)
