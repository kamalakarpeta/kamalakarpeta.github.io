    [Deprecated] Traverse the DataPipes and their attributes to extract the DataPipe graph. When
    ``only_dataPipe`` is specified as ``True``, it would only look into the attribute
    from each DataPipe that is either a DataPipe and a Python collection object such as
    ``list``, ``tuple``, ``set`` and ``dict``.

    Note:
        This function is deprecated. Please use `traverse_dps` instead.

        datapipe: the end DataPipe of the graph
        only_datapipe: If ``False`` (default), all attributes of each DataPipe are traversed.
          This argument is deprecating and will be removed after the next release.
