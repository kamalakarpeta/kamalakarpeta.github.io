    """Returns the information about the current
    :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` iterator worker process.

    When called in a worker, this returns an object guaranteed to have the
    following attributes:

    * :attr:`id`: the current worker id.
    * :attr:`num_workers`: the total number of workers.
    * :attr:`seed`: the random seed set for the current worker. This value is
      determined by main process RNG and the worker id. See
      :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader`'s documentation for more details.
    * :attr:`dataset`: the copy of the dataset object in **this** process. Note
      that this will be a different object in a different process than the one
      in the main process.

    When called in the main process, this returns ``None``.

    .. note::
       When used in a :attr:`worker_init_fn` passed over to
       :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, this method can be useful to
       set up each worker process differently, for instance, using ``worker_id``
       to configure the ``dataset`` object to only read a specific fraction of a
       sharded dataset, or use ``seed`` to seed other libraries used in dataset
       code.
