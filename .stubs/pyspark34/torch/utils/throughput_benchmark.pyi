class ThroughputBenchmark:
    '''
    This class is a wrapper around a c++ component throughput_benchmark::ThroughputBenchmark
    responsible for executing a PyTorch module (nn.Module or ScriptModule)
    under an inference server like load. It can emulate multiple calling threads
    to a single module provided. In the future we plan to enhance this component
    to support inter and intra-op parallelism as well as multiple models
    running in a single process.

    Please note that even though nn.Module is supported, it might incur an overhead
    from the need to hold GIL every time we execute Python code or pass around
    inputs as Python objects. As soon as you have a ScriptModule version of your
    model for inference deployment it is better to switch to using it in this
    benchmark.

    Example::

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("undefined vars")
        >>> from torch.utils import ThroughputBenchmark
        >>> bench = ThroughputBenchmark(my_module)
        >>> # Pre-populate benchmark\'s data set with the inputs
        >>> for input in inputs:
        ...     # Both args and kwargs work, same as any PyTorch Module / ScriptModule
        ...     bench.add_input(input[0], x2=input[1])
        >>> # Inputs supplied above are randomly used during the execution
        >>> stats = bench.benchmark(
        ...     num_calling_threads=4,
        ...     num_warmup_iters = 100,
        ...     num_iters = 1000,
        ... )
        >>> print("Avg latency (ms): {}".format(stats.latency_avg_ms))
        >>> print("Number of iterations: {}".format(stats.num_iters))

        This function returns BenchmarkExecutionStats object which is defined via pybind11.
        It currently has two fields:
            - num_iters - number of actual iterations the benchmark have made
            - avg_latency_ms - average time it took to infer on one input example in milliseconds
