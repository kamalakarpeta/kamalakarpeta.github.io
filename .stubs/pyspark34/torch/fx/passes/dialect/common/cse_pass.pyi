        This version of CSE Pass aims to be dialect agnostic, and it's implemented purely based on the connectivity between fx.Node.

        For functional dialects, user would only need to specify the random ops in ban list.

        Warning: CSE Pass cannot be safely applied on a FX graph in non-functional dialects.
        If your dialect contains stateful operators, please customized the banned_ops.
