class Proxy:
    '''
    ``Proxy`` objects are ``Node`` wrappers that flow through the
    program during symbolic tracing and record all the operations
    (``torch`` function calls, method calls, operators) that they touch
    into the growing FX Graph.

    If you\'re doing graph transforms, you can wrap your own ``Proxy``
    method around a raw ``Node`` so that you can use the overloaded
    operators to add additional things to a ``Graph``.

    ``Proxy`` objects cannot be iterated. In other words, the symbolic
    tracer will throw an error if a ``Proxy`` is used in a loop or as
    an ``*args``/``**kwargs`` function argument.

    There are two main ways around this:
    1. Factor out the untraceable logic into a top-level function and
    use ``fx.wrap`` on it.
    2. If the control flow is static (i.e. the loop trip count is
    based on some hyperparameter), the code can be kept in its original
    position and refactored into something like::

        for i in range(self.some_hyperparameter):
            indexed_item = proxied_value[i]
