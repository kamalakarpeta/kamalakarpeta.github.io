    '''Find the k largest (or smallest) eigenvalues and the corresponding
    eigenvectors of a symmetric positive definite generalized
    eigenvalue problem using matrix-free LOBPCG methods.

    This function is a front-end to the following LOBPCG algorithms
    selectable via `method` argument:

      `method="basic"` - the LOBPCG method introduced by Andrew
      Knyazev, see [Knyazev2001]. A less robust method, may fail when
      Cholesky is applied to singular input.

      `method="ortho"` - the LOBPCG method with orthogonal basis
      selection [StathopoulosEtal2002]. A robust method.

    Supported inputs are dense, sparse, and batches of dense matrices.

    .. note:: In general, the basic method spends least time per
      iteration. However, the robust methods converge much faster and
      are more stable. So, the usage of the basic method is generally
      not recommended but there exist cases where the usage of the
      basic method may be preferred.

    .. warning:: The backward method does not support sparse and complex inputs.
      It works only when `B` is not provided (i.e. `B == None`).
      We are actively working on extensions, and the details of
      the algorithms are going to be published promptly.

    .. warning:: While it is assumed that `A` is symmetric, `A.grad` is not.
      To make sure that `A.grad` is symmetric, so that `A - t * A.grad` is symmetric
      in first-order optimization routines, prior to running `lobpcg`
      we do the following symmetrization map: `A -> (A + A.t()) / 2`.
      The map is performed only when the `A` requires gradients.

    Args:

      A (Tensor): the input tensor of size :math:`(*, m, m)`

      B (Tensor, optional): the input tensor of size :math:`(*, m,
                  m)`. When not specified, `B` is interpreted as
                  identity matrix.

      X (tensor, optional): the input tensor of size :math:`(*, m, n)`
                  where `k <= n <= m`. When specified, it is used as
                  initial approximation of eigenvectors. X must be a
                  dense tensor.

      iK (tensor, optional): the input tensor of size :math:`(*, m,
                  m)`. When specified, it will be used as preconditioner.

      k (integer, optional): the number of requested
                  eigenpairs. Default is the number of :math:`X`
                  columns (when specified) or `1`.

      n (integer, optional): if :math:`X` is not specified then `n`
                  specifies the size of the generated random
                  approximation of eigenvectors. Default value for `n`
                  is `k`. If :math:`X` is specified, the value of `n`
                  (when specified) must be the number of :math:`X`
                  columns.

      tol (float, optional): residual tolerance for stopping
                 criterion. Default is `feps ** 0.5` where `feps` is
                 smallest non-zero floating-point number of the given
                 input tensor `A` data type.

      largest (bool, optional): when True, solve the eigenproblem for
                 the largest eigenvalues. Otherwise, solve the
                 eigenproblem for smallest eigenvalues. Default is
                 `True`.

      method (str, optional): select LOBPCG method. See the
                 description of the function above. Default is
                 "ortho".

      niter (int, optional): maximum number of iterations. When
                 reached, the iteration process is hard-stopped and
                 the current approximation of eigenpairs is returned.
                 For infinite iteration but until convergence criteria
                 is met, use `-1`.

      tracker (callable, optional) : a function for tracing the
                 iteration process. When specified, it is called at
                 each iteration step with LOBPCG instance as an
                 argument. The LOBPCG instance holds the full state of
                 the iteration process in the following attributes:

                   `iparams`, `fparams`, `bparams` - dictionaries of
                   integer, float, and boolean valued input
                   parameters, respectively

                   `ivars`, `fvars`, `bvars`, `tvars` - dictionaries
                   of integer, float, boolean, and Tensor valued
                   iteration variables, respectively.

                   `A`, `B`, `iK` - input Tensor arguments.

                   `E`, `X`, `S`, `R` - iteration Tensor variables.

                 For instance:

                   `ivars["istep"]` - the current iteration step
                   `X` - the current approximation of eigenvectors
                   `E` - the current approximation of eigenvalues
                   `R` - the current residual
                   `ivars["converged_count"]` - the current number of converged eigenpairs
                   `tvars["rerr"]` - the current state of convergence criteria

                 Note that when `tracker` stores Tensor objects from
                 the LOBPCG instance, it must make copies of these.

                 If `tracker` sets `bvars["force_stop"] = True`, the
                 iteration process will be hard-stopped.

      ortho_iparams, ortho_fparams, ortho_bparams (dict, optional):
                 various parameters to LOBPCG algorithm when using
                 `method="ortho"`.

    Returns:

      E (Tensor): tensor of eigenvalues of size :math:`(*, k)`

      X (Tensor): tensor of eigenvectors of size :math:`(*, m, k)`
