    The tangent attribute can be recovered with :func:`unpack_dual`.

    This function is backward differentiable.

    Given a function `f` whose jacobian is `J`, it allows one to compute the Jacobian-vector product (`jvp`)
    between `J` and a given vector `v` as follows.

    Example::

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("Undefined variables")
        >>> with dual_level():
        ...     inp = make_dual(x, v)
