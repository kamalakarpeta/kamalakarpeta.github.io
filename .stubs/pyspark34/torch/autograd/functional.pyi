def jacobian(func, inputs, create_graph: bool = False, strict: bool = False, vectorize: bool = False, strategy: str = 'reverse-mode'):

    Args:
        func (function): a Python function that takes Tensor inputs and returns
            a tuple of Tensors or a Tensor.
        inputs (tuple of Tensors or Tensor): inputs to the function ``func``.
        create_graph (bool, optional): If ``True``, the Jacobian will be
            computed in a differentiable manner. Note that when ``strict`` is
            ``False``, the result can not require gradients or be disconnected

            independent of it. If ``False``, we return a Tensor of zeros as the
            jacobian for said inputs, which is the expected mathematical value.
            Defaults to ``False``.
        vectorize (bool, optional): This feature is experimental.
            Please consider using :func:`torch.func.jacrev` or
            :func:`torch.func.jacfwd` instead if you are looking for something
            less experimental and more performant.
            When computing the jacobian, usually we invoke
            ``autograd.grad`` once per row of the jacobian. If this flag is
            ``True``, we perform only a single ``autograd.grad`` call with
            ``batched_grad=True`` which uses the vmap prototype feature.
            Though this should lead to performance improvements in many cases,
            because this feature is still experimental, there may be performance
            cliffs. See :func:`torch.autograd.grad`\'s ``batched_grad`` parameter for
            more information.
        strategy (str, optional): Set to ``"forward-mode"`` or ``"reverse-mode"`` to
            determine whether the Jacobian will be computed with forward or reverse
            mode AD. Currently, ``"forward-mode"`` requires ``vectorized=True``.
            Defaults to ``"reverse-mode"``. If ``func`` has more outputs than
            inputs, ``"forward-mode"`` tends to be more performant. Otherwise,
            prefer to use ``"reverse-mode"``.

    Returns:
        Jacobian (Tensor or nested tuple of Tensors): if there is a single
        input and output, this will be a single Tensor containing the
        Jacobian for the linearized inputs and output. If one of the two is
        a tuple, then the Jacobian will be a tuple of Tensors. If both of
        them are tuples, then the Jacobian will be a tuple of tuple of
        Tensors where ``Jacobian[i][j]`` will contain the Jacobian of the
        ``i``\\th output and ``j``\\th input and will have as size the
        concatenation of the sizes of the corresponding output and the
        corresponding input and will have same dtype and device as the
        corresponding input. If strategy is ``forward-mode``, the dtype will be
        that of the output; otherwise, the input.

        outer_jacobian_strategy (str, optional): The Hessian is computed by
            computing the Jacobian of a Jacobian. The inner Jacobian is always
            computed in reverse-mode AD. Setting strategy to ``"forward-mode"``
            or ``"reverse-mode"`` determines whether the outer Jacobian will be
            computed with forward or reverse mode AD. Currently, computing the outer
            Jacobian in ``"forward-mode"`` requires ``vectorized=True``. Defaults
            to ``"reverse-mode"``.

    Returns:
        Hessian (Tensor or a tuple of tuple of Tensors): if there is a single input,
        this will be a single Tensor containing the Hessian for the input.

        and ``j``\\th input with size the sum of the size of the ``i``\\th input plus
        the size of the ``j``\\th input. ``Hessian[i][j]`` will have the same

            detect that there exists an input such that all the outputs are
            independent of it. If ``False``, we return a Tensor of zeros as the
            hvp for said inputs, which is the expected mathematical value.
            Defaults to ``False``.
    Returns:
        output (tuple): tuple with:
            func_output (tuple of Tensors or Tensor): output of ``func(inputs)``

            hvp (tuple of Tensors or Tensor): result of the dot product with
            the same shape as the inputs.

    Example:

        >>> # xdoctest: +REQUIRES(env:TORCH_DOCTEST_AUTOGRAD)
        >>> def pow_reducer(x):
        ...     return x.pow(3).sum()
        >>> inputs = torch.rand(2, 2)
        >>> v = torch.ones(2, 2)
        >>> # xdoctest: +IGNORE_WANT("non-deterministic")
        >>> hvp(pow_reducer, inputs, v)
        (tensor(0.1448),
         tensor([[2.0239, 1.6456],
                 [2.4988, 1.4310]]))

        >>> hvp(pow_reducer, inputs, v, create_graph=True)
        (tensor(0.1448, grad_fn=<SumBackward0>),
         tensor([[2.0239, 1.6456],
                 [2.4988, 1.4310]], grad_fn=<MulBackward0>))


        >>> def pow_adder_reducer(x, y):
        ...     return (2 * x.pow(2) + 3 * y.pow(2)).sum()
        >>> inputs = (torch.rand(2), torch.rand(2))
        >>> v = (torch.zeros(2), torch.ones(2))
        >>> hvp(pow_adder_reducer, inputs, v)
        (tensor(2.3030),
         (tensor([0., 0.]),
          tensor([6., 6.])))

    Note:

        This function is significantly slower than `vhp` due to backward mode AD constraints.
        If your functions is twice continuously differentiable, then hvp = vhp.t(). So if you
        know that your function satisfies this condition, you should use vhp instead that is
        much faster with the current implementation.
