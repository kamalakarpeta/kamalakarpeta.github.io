        ``save_for_backward`` should be called at most once, only from inside the
        :func:`forward` method, and only with tensors.

        All tensors intended to be used in the backward pass should be saved
        with ``save_for_backward`` (as opposed to directly on ``ctx``) to prevent
        incorrect gradients and memory leaks, and enable the application of saved
        tensor hooks. See :class:`torch.autograd.graph.saved_tensors_hooks`.

        Note that if intermediary tensors, tensors that are neither inputs
        nor outputs of :func:`forward`, are saved for backward, your custom Function
        may not support double backward.
        Custom Functions that do not support double backward should decorate their
        :func:`backward` method with ``@once_differentiable`` so that performing
        double backward raises an error. If you'd like to support double backward,
        you can either recompute intermediaries based on the inputs during backward
        or return the intermediaries as the outputs of the custom Function. See the
        `double backward tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/custom_function_double_backward_tutorial.html>`_
        for more details.

        In :func:`backward`, saved tensors can be accessed through the :attr:`saved_tensors`
        attribute. Before returning them to the user, a check is made to ensure
        they weren't used in any in-place operation that modified their content.

        Arguments can also be ``None``. This is a no-op.
