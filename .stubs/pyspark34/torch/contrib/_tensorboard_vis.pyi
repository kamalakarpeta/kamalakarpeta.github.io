        inline_graph (Callable): a function that handles setting up a value_map,
            so that some graphs in here can be inlined. This is necessary, because
            this will simply be `visualize` for the top-level GraphExecutor,
            or `inline_graph` for all nested ones.

            The signature should look like (Graph, name_prefix) -> ().
            It will be called exactly once.

    The strategy is to embed all different configurations as independent subgraphs,
    while inlining the original graph as the one that actually produces the values.
