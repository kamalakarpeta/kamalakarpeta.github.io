def einsum(*args: Any) -> Tensor:
    '''einsum(equation, *operands) -> Tensor

    Sums the product of the elements of the input :attr:`operands` along dimensions specified using a notation
    based on the Einstein summation convention.

    Einsum allows computing many common multi-dimensional linear algebraic array operations by representing them
    in a short-hand format based on the Einstein summation convention, given by :attr:`equation`. The details of
    this format are described below, but the general idea is to label every dimension of the input :attr:`operands`
    with some subscript and define which subscripts are part of the output. The output is then computed by summing
    the product of the elements of the :attr:`operands` along the dimensions whose subscripts are not part of the
    output. For example, matrix multiplication can be computed using einsum as `torch.einsum("ij,jk->ik", A, B)`.
    Here, j is the summation subscript and i and k the output subscripts (see section below for more details on why).

    Equation:

        The :attr:`equation` string specifies the subscripts (letters in `[a-zA-Z]`) for each dimension of
        the input :attr:`operands` in the same order as the dimensions, separating subscripts for each operand by a
        comma (\',\'), e.g. `\'ij,jk\'` specify subscripts for two 2D operands. The dimensions labeled with the same subscript
        must be broadcastable, that is, their size must either match or be `1`. The exception is if a subscript is
        repeated for the same input operand, in which case the dimensions labeled with this subscript for this operand
        must match in size and the operand will be replaced by its diagonal along these dimensions. The subscripts that
        appear exactly once in the :attr:`equation` will be part of the output, sorted in increasing alphabetical order.
        The output is computed by multiplying the input :attr:`operands` element-wise, with their dimensions aligned based
        on the subscripts, and then summing out the dimensions whose subscripts are not part of the output.

        Optionally, the output subscripts can be explicitly defined by adding an arrow (\'->\') at the end of the equation
        followed by the subscripts for the output. For instance, the following equation computes the transpose of a
        matrix multiplication: \'ij,jk->ki\'. The output subscripts must appear at least once for some input operand and
        at most once for the output.

        Ellipsis (\'...\') can be used in place of subscripts to broadcast the dimensions covered by the ellipsis.
        Each input operand may contain at most one ellipsis which will cover the dimensions not covered by subscripts,
        e.g. for an input operand with 5 dimensions, the ellipsis in the equation `\'ab...c\'` cover the third and fourth
        dimensions. The ellipsis does not need to cover the same number of dimensions across the :attr:`operands` but the
        \'shape\' of the ellipsis (the size of the dimensions covered by them) must broadcast together. If the output is not
        explicitly defined with the arrow (\'->\') notation, the ellipsis will come first in the output (left-most dimensions),
        before the subscript labels that appear exactly once for the input operands. e.g. the following equation implements
        batch matrix multiplication `\'...ij,...jk\'`.

        A few final notes: the equation may contain whitespaces between the different elements (subscripts, ellipsis,
        arrow and comma) but something like `\'. . .\'` is not valid. An empty string `\'\'` is valid for scalar operands.

    .. note::

        ``torch.einsum`` handles ellipsis (\'...\') differently from NumPy in that it allows dimensions
        covered by the ellipsis to be summed over, that is, ellipsis are not required to be part of the output.

    .. note::

        This function uses opt_einsum (https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to speed up computation or to
        consume less memory by optimizing contraction order. This optimization occurs when there are at least three
        inputs, since the order does not matter otherwise. Note that finding _the_ optimal path is an NP-hard problem,
        thus, opt_einsum relies on different heuristics to achieve near-optimal results. If opt_einsum is not available,
        the default order is to contract from left to right.

        To bypass this default behavior, add the following line to disable the usage of opt_einsum and skip path
        calculation: `torch.backends.opt_einsum.enabled = False`

        To specify which strategy you\'d like for opt_einsum to compute the contraction path, add the following line:
        `torch.backends.opt_einsum.strategy = \'auto\'`. The default strategy is \'auto\', and we also support \'greedy\' and
        \'optimal\'. Disclaimer that the runtime of \'optimal\' is factorial in the number of inputs! See more details in
        the opt_einsum documentation (https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/stable/path_finding.html).

    .. note::

        As of PyTorch 1.10 :func:`torch.einsum` also supports the sublist format (see examples below). In this format,
        subscripts for each operand are specified by sublists, list of integers in the range [0, 52). These sublists
        follow their operands, and an extra sublist can appear at the end of the input to specify the output\'s
        subscripts., e.g. `torch.einsum(op1, sublist1, op2, sublist2, ..., [subslist_out])`. Python\'s `Ellipsis` object
        may be provided in a sublist to enable broadcasting as described in the Equation section above.

    Args:
        equation (str): The subscripts for the Einstein summation.
        operands (List[Tensor]): The tensors to compute the Einstein summation of.

    .. warning::
        From version 1.8.0, :attr:`return_complex` must always be given
        explicitly for real inputs and `return_complex=False` has been
        deprecated. Strongly prefer `return_complex=True` as in a future
        pytorch release, this function will only return complex tensors.

        Note that :func:`torch.view_as_real` can be used to recover a real
        tensor with an extra last dimension for real and imaginary components.

    The STFT computes the Fourier transform of short overlapping windows of the
    input. This giving frequency components of the signal as they change over
    time. The interface of this function is modeled after (but *not* a drop-in
    replacement for) librosa_ stft function.

    .. _librosa: https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.stft.html

    Ignoring the optional batch dimension, this method computes the following
    expression:

    .. math::
        X[\\omega, m] = \\sum_{k = 0}^{\\text{win\\_length-1}}%
                            \\text{window}[k]\\ \\text{input}[m \\times \\text{hop\\_length} + k]\\ %
                            \\exp\\left(- j \\frac{2 \\pi \\cdot \\omega k}{\\text{win\\_length}}\\right),

    where :math:`m` is the index of the sliding window, and :math:`\\omega` is
    the frequency :math:`0 \\leq \\omega < \\text{n\\_fft}` for ``onesided=False``,
    or :math:`0 \\leq \\omega < \\lfloor \\text{n\\_fft} / 2 \\rfloor + 1` for ``onesided=True``.

    * :attr:`input` must be either a 1-D time sequence or a 2-D batch of time
      sequences.

    * If :attr:`hop_length` is ``None`` (default), it is treated as equal to
      ``floor(n_fft / 4)``.

    * If :attr:`win_length` is ``None`` (default), it is treated as equal to
      :attr:`n_fft`.

    * :attr:`window` can be a 1-D tensor of size :attr:`win_length`, e.g., from
      :meth:`torch.hann_window`. If :attr:`window` is ``None`` (default), it is
      treated as if having :math:`1` everywhere in the window. If
      :math:`\\text{win\\_length} < \\text{n\\_fft}`, :attr:`window` will be padded on
      both sides to length :attr:`n_fft` before being applied.

    * If :attr:`center` is ``True`` (default), :attr:`input` will be padded on
      both sides so that the :math:`t`-th frame is centered at time
      :math:`t \\times \\text{hop\\_length}`. Otherwise, the :math:`t`-th frame
      begins at time  :math:`t \\times \\text{hop\\_length}`.

    * :attr:`pad_mode` determines the padding method used on :attr:`input` when
      :attr:`center` is ``True``. See :meth:`torch.nn.functional.pad` for
      all available options. Default is ``"reflect"``.

    * If :attr:`onesided` is ``True`` (default for real input), only values for
      :math:`\\omega` in :math:`\\left[0, 1, 2, \\dots, \\left\\lfloor
      \\frac{\\text{n\\_fft}}{2} \\right\\rfloor + 1\\right]` are returned because
      the real-to-complex Fourier transform satisfies the conjugate symmetry,
      i.e., :math:`X[m, \\omega] = X[m, \\text{n\\_fft} - \\omega]^*`.
      Note if the input or window tensors are complex, then :attr:`onesided`
      output is not possible.

    * If :attr:`normalized` is ``True`` (default is ``False``), the function
      returns the normalized STFT results, i.e., multiplied by :math:`(\\text{frame\\_length})^{-0.5}`.

    * If :attr:`return_complex` is ``True`` (default if input is complex), the
      return is a ``input.dim() + 1`` dimensional complex tensor. If ``False``,
      the output is a ``input.dim() + 2`` dimensional real tensor where the last
      dimension represents the real and imaginary components.

    Returns either a complex tensor of size :math:`(* \\times N \\times T)` if
    :attr:`return_complex` is true, or a real tensor of size :math:`(* \\times N
    \\times T \\times 2)`. Where :math:`*` is the optional batch size of
    :attr:`input`, :math:`N` is the number of frequencies where STFT is applied
    and :math:`T` is the total number of frames used.

    """Returns the matrix norm or vector norm of a given tensor.

    .. warning::

        torch.norm is deprecated and may be removed in a future PyTorch release.
        Its documentation and behavior may be incorrect, and it is no longer
        actively maintained.

        Use :func:`torch.linalg.vector_norm` when computing vector norms and
        :func:`torch.linalg.matrix_norm` when computing matrix norms.
        For a function with a similar behavior as this one see :func:`torch.linalg.norm`.
        Note, however, the signature for these functions is slightly different than the
        signature for ``torch.norm``.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): The input tensor. Its data type must be either a floating
            point or complex type. For complex inputs, the norm is calculated using the
            absolute value of each element. If the input is complex and neither
            :attr:`dtype` nor :attr:`out` is specified, the result's data type will
            be the corresponding floating point type (e.g. float if :attr:`input` is
            complexfloat).

        p (int, float, inf, -inf, 'fro', 'nuc', optional): the order of norm. Default: ``'fro'``
            The following norms can be calculated:

            ======  ==============  ==========================
            ord     matrix norm     vector norm
            ======  ==============  ==========================
            'fro'   Frobenius norm  --
            'nuc'   nuclear norm    --
            Number  --              sum(abs(x)**ord)**(1./ord)
            ======  ==============  ==========================

            The vector norm can be calculated across any number of dimensions.
            The corresponding dimensions of :attr:`input` are flattened into
            one dimension, and the norm is calculated on the flattened
            dimension.

            Frobenius norm produces the same result as ``p=2`` in all cases
            except when :attr:`dim` is a list of three or more dims, in which
            case Frobenius norm throws an error.

            Nuclear norm can only be calculated across exactly two dimensions.

        dim (int, tuple of ints, list of ints, optional):
            Specifies which dimension or dimensions of :attr:`input` to
            calculate the norm across. If :attr:`dim` is ``None``, the norm will
            be calculated across all dimensions of :attr:`input`. If the norm
            type indicated by :attr:`p` does not support the specified number of
            dimensions, an error will occur.
        keepdim (bool, optional): whether the output tensors have :attr:`dim`
            retained or not. Ignored if :attr:`dim` = ``None`` and
            :attr:`out` = ``None``. Default: ``False``
        out (Tensor, optional): the output tensor. Ignored if
            :attr:`dim` = ``None`` and :attr:`out` = ``None``.
        dtype (:class:`torch.dtype`, optional): the desired data type of
            returned tensor. If specified, the input tensor is casted to
            :attr:`dtype` while performing the operation. Default: None.

    .. note::
        Even though ``p='fro'`` supports any number of dimensions, the true
        mathematical definition of Frobenius norm only applies to tensors with
        exactly two dimensions. :func:`torch.linalg.matrix_norm` with ``ord='fro'``
        aligns with the mathematical definition, since it can only be applied across
        exactly two dimensions.

    Example::

        >>> import torch
        >>> a = torch.arange(9, dtype= torch.float) - 4
        >>> b = a.reshape((3, 3))
