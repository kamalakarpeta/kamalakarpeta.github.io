    The mean and standard-deviation are calculated per-dimension over
    the mini-batches and :math:`\\gamma` and :math:`\\beta` are learnable parameter vectors
    of size `C` (where `C` is the number of features or channels of the input). By default, the
    elements of :math:`\\gamma` are set to 1 and the elements of :math:`\\beta` are set to 0. The

    Also by default, during training this layer keeps running estimates of its
