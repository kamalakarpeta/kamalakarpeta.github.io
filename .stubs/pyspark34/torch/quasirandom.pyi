class SobolEngine:
    '''
    The :class:`torch.quasirandom.SobolEngine` is an engine for generating
    (scrambled) Sobol sequences. Sobol sequences are an example of low
    discrepancy quasi-random sequences.

    This implementation of an engine for Sobol sequences is capable of
    sampling sequences up to a maximum dimension of 21201. It uses direction
    numbers from https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~fkuo/sobol/ obtained using the
    search criterion D(6) up to the dimension 21201. This is the recommended
    choice by the authors.

    Args:
        dimension (Int): The dimensionality of the sequence to be drawn
        scramble (bool, optional): Setting this to ``True`` will produce
                                   scrambled Sobol sequences. Scrambling is
                                   capable of producing better Sobol
                                   sequences. Default: ``False``.
        seed (Int, optional): This is the seed for the scrambling. The seed
                              of the random number generator is set to this,
                              if specified. Otherwise, it uses a random seed.
                              Default: ``None``

    Examples::

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("unseeded random state")
        >>> soboleng = torch.quasirandom.SobolEngine(dimension=5)
        >>> soboleng.draw(3)
        tensor([[0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000],
                [0.5000, 0.5000, 0.5000, 0.5000, 0.5000],
                [0.7500, 0.2500, 0.2500, 0.2500, 0.7500]])
