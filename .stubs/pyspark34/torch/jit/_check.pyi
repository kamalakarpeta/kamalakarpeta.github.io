class AttributeTypeIsSupportedChecker(ast.NodeVisitor):
    '''
    Checks the ``__init__`` method of a given ``nn.Module`` to ensure
    that all instance-level attributes can be properly initialized.

    Specifically, we do type inference based on attribute values...even
    if the attribute in question has already been typed using
    Python3-style annotations or ``torch.jit.annotate``. This means that
    setting an instance-level attribute to ``[]`` (for ``List``),
    ``{}`` for ``Dict``), or ``None`` (for ``Optional``) isn\'t enough
    information for us to properly initialize that attribute.

    An object of this class can walk a given ``nn.Module``\'s AST and
    determine if it meets our requirements or not.

    Known limitations
    1. We can only check the AST nodes for certain constructs; we can\'t
    ``eval`` arbitrary expressions. This means that function calls,
    class instantiations, and complex expressions that resolve to one of
    the "empty" values specified above will NOT be flagged as
    problematic.
    2. We match on string literals, so if the user decides to use a
    non-standard import (e.g. `from typing import List as foo`), we
    won\'t catch it.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            class M(torch.nn.Module):
                def fn(self):
                    return []

                def __init__(self):
                    super().__init__()
                    self.x: List[int] = []

                def forward(self, x: List[int]):
                    self.x = x
                    return 1

        The above code will pass the ``AttributeTypeIsSupportedChecker``
        check since we have a function call in ``__init__``. However,
        it will still fail later with the ``RuntimeError`` "Tried to set
        nonexistent attribute: x. Did you forget to initialize it in
        __init__()?".
