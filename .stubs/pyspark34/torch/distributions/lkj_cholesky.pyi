class LKJCholesky(Distribution):
    '''
    LKJ distribution for lower Cholesky factor of correlation matrices.
    The distribution is controlled by ``concentration`` parameter :math:`\\eta`
    to make the probability of the correlation matrix :math:`M` generated from
    a Cholesky factor proportional to :math:`\\det(M)^{\\eta - 1}`. Because of that,
    when ``concentration == 1``, we have a uniform distribution over Cholesky
    factors of correlation matrices::

        L ~ LKJCholesky(dim, concentration)
        X = L @ L\' ~ LKJCorr(dim, concentration)

    Note that this distribution samples the
    Cholesky factor of correlation matrices and not the correlation matrices
    themselves and thereby differs slightly from the derivations in [1] for
    the `LKJCorr` distribution. For sampling, this uses the Onion method from
    [1] Section 3.

    Example::

        >>> # xdoctest: +IGNORE_WANT("non-deterinistic")
        >>> l = LKJCholesky(3, 0.5)
        >>> l.sample()  # l @ l.T is a sample of a correlation 3x3 matrix
        tensor([[ 1.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000],
                [ 0.3516,  0.9361,  0.0000],
                [-0.1899,  0.4748,  0.8593]])

    Args:
        dimension (dim): dimension of the matrices
        concentration (float or Tensor): concentration/shape parameter of the
            distribution (often referred to as eta)
