    Load a model from a github repo or a local directory.

    Note: Loading a model is the typical use case, but this can also be used to
    for loading other objects such as tokenizers, loss functions, etc.

            ``source = \'local\'``. Default is ``False``.
        verbose (bool, optional): If ``False``, mute messages about hitting
            local caches. Note that the message about first download cannot be
            muted. Does not have any effect if ``source = \'local\'``.
