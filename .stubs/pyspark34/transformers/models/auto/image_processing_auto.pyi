    '''
    Loads the image processor configuration from a pretrained model image processor configuration.

    Args:
        pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`):
            This can be either:

            - a string, the *model id* of a pretrained model configuration hosted inside a model repo on
              huggingface.co. Valid model ids can be located at the root-level, like `bert-base-uncased`, or namespaced
              under a user or organization name, like `dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased`.
            - a path to a *directory* containing a configuration file saved using the
              [`~PreTrainedTokenizer.save_pretrained`] method, e.g., `./my_model_directory/`.

        cache_dir (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
            Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model configuration should be cached if the standard
            cache should not be used.
        force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to force to (re-)download the configuration files and override the cached versions if they
            exist.
        resume_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to delete incompletely received file. Attempts to resume the download if such a file exists.
        proxies (`Dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
            A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{\'http\': \'foo.bar:3128\',
            \'http://hostname\': \'foo.bar:4012\'}.` The proxies are used on each request.
        use_auth_token (`str` or *bool*, *optional*):
            The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, will use the token generated
            when running `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
        revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
            The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
            git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
            identifier allowed by git.
        local_files_only (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            If `True`, will only try to load the image processor configuration from local files.

    <Tip>

    Passing `use_auth_token=True` is required when you want to use a private model.

    </Tip>

    Returns:
        `Dict`: The configuration of the image processor.

    Examples:

    ```python
    # Download configuration from huggingface.co and cache.
    image_processor_config = get_image_processor_config("bert-base-uncased")
    # This model does not have a image processor config so the result will be an empty dict.
    image_processor_config = get_image_processor_config("xlm-roberta-base")

    # Save a pretrained image processor locally and you can reload its config
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer

    image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k")

                exists.
            proxies (`Dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{\'http\': \'foo.bar:3128\',
                \'http://hostname\': \'foo.bar:4012\'}.` The proxies are used on each request.
            use_auth_token (`str` or *bool*, *optional*):

                when running `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.
            return_unused_kwargs (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                If `False`, then this function returns just the final image processor object. If `True`, then this
                functions returns a `Tuple(image_processor, unused_kwargs)` where *unused_kwargs* is a dictionary
                consisting of the key/value pairs whose keys are not image processor attributes: i.e., the part of
                `kwargs` which has not been used to update `image_processor` and is otherwise ignored.
            trust_remote_code (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to allow for custom models defined on the Hub in their own modeling files. This option
                should only be set to `True` for repositories you trust and in which you have read the code, as it will
                execute code present on the Hub on your local machine.
            kwargs (`Dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
                The values in kwargs of any keys which are image processor attributes will be used to override the
                loaded values. Behavior concerning key/value pairs whose keys are *not* image processor attributes is
                controlled by the `return_unused_kwargs` keyword parameter.
