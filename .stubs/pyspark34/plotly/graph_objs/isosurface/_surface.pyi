        Sets the surface pattern of the iso-surface 3-D sections. The
        default pattern of the surface is `all` meaning that the rest
        of surface elements would be shaded. The check options (either
        1 or 2) could be used to draw half of the squares on the
        surface. Using various combinations of capital `A`, `B`, `C`,
        `D` and `E` may also be used to reduce the number of triangles
        on the iso-surfaces and creating other patterns of interest.

        The 'pattern' property is a flaglist and may be specified
        as a string containing:
          - Any combination of ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'] joined with '+' characters
