class HunposTagger(TaggerI):
    '''
    A class for pos tagging with HunPos. The input is the paths to:
     - a model trained on training data
     - (optionally) the path to the hunpos-tag binary
     - (optionally) the encoding of the training data (default: ISO-8859-1)

    Check whether the required "hunpos-tag" binary is available:

        >>> from nltk.test.setup_fixt import check_binary
        >>> check_binary(\'hunpos-tag\')

    Example:
        >>> from nltk.tag import HunposTagger
        >>> ht = HunposTagger(\'en_wsj.model\')
        >>> ht.tag(\'What is the airspeed of an unladen swallow ?\'.split())
        [(\'What\', \'WP\'), (\'is\', \'VBZ\'), (\'the\', \'DT\'), (\'airspeed\', \'NN\'), (\'of\', \'IN\'), (\'an\', \'DT\'), (\'unladen\', \'NN\'), (\'swallow\', \'VB\'), (\'?\', \'.\')]
        >>> ht.close()

    This class communicates with the hunpos-tag binary via pipes. When the
    tagger object is no longer needed, the close() method should be called to
    free system resources. The class supports the context manager interface; if
    used in a with statement, the close() method is invoked automatically:

        >>> with HunposTagger(\'en_wsj.model\') as ht:
        ...     ht.tag(\'What is the airspeed of an unladen swallow ?\'.split())
        ...
        [(\'What\', \'WP\'), (\'is\', \'VBZ\'), (\'the\', \'DT\'), (\'airspeed\', \'NN\'), (\'of\', \'IN\'), (\'an\', \'DT\'), (\'unladen\', \'NN\'), (\'swallow\', \'VB\'), (\'?\', \'.\')]
