class AbstractParentedTree(Tree, metaclass=ABCMeta):
    '''
    An abstract base class for a ``Tree`` that automatically maintains
    pointers to parent nodes.  These parent pointers are updated
    whenever any change is made to a tree\'s structure.  Two subclasses
    are currently defined:

      - ``ParentedTree`` is used for tree structures where each subtree
        has at most one parent.  This class should be used in cases
        where there is no"sharing" of subtrees.

      - ``MultiParentedTree`` is used for tree structures where a
        subtree may have zero or more parents.  This class should be
        used in cases where subtrees may be shared.

    Subclassing
    ===========
    The ``AbstractParentedTree`` class redefines all operations that
    modify a tree\'s structure to call two methods, which are used by
    subclasses to update parent information:

      - ``_setparent()`` is called whenever a new child is added.
      - ``_delparent()`` is called whenever a child is removed.
