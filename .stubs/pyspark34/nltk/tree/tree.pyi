class Tree(list):
    '''
    A Tree represents a hierarchical grouping of leaves and subtrees.
    For example, each constituent in a syntax tree is represented by a single Tree.

    A tree\'s children are encoded as a list of leaves and subtrees,
    where a leaf is a basic (non-tree) value; and a subtree is a
    nested Tree.

        >>> from nltk.tree import Tree
        >>> print(Tree(1, [2, Tree(3, [4]), 5]))
        (1 2 (3 4) 5)
        >>> vp = Tree(\'VP\', [Tree(\'V\', [\'saw\']),
        ...                  Tree(\'NP\', [\'him\'])])
        >>> s = Tree(\'S\', [Tree(\'NP\', [\'I\']), vp])
        >>> print(s)
        (S (NP I) (VP (V saw) (NP him)))
        >>> print(s[1])
        (VP (V saw) (NP him))
        >>> print(s[1,1])
        (NP him)
        >>> t = Tree.fromstring("(S (NP I) (VP (V saw) (NP him)))")
        >>> s == t
        True
        >>> t[1][1].set_label(\'X\')
        >>> t[1][1].label()
        \'X\'
        >>> print(t)
        (S (NP I) (VP (V saw) (X him)))
        >>> t[0], t[1,1] = t[1,1], t[0]
        >>> print(t)
        (S (X him) (VP (V saw) (NP I)))

    The length of a tree is the number of children it has.

        >>> len(t)
        2

    The set_label() and label() methods allow individual constituents
    to be labeled.  For example, syntax trees use this label to specify
    phrase tags, such as "NP" and "VP".

    Several Tree methods use "tree positions" to specify
    children or descendants of a tree.  Tree positions are defined as
    follows:

      - The tree position *i* specifies a Tree\'s *i*\\ th child.
      - The tree position ``()`` specifies the Tree itself.
      - If *p* is the tree position of descendant *d*, then
        *p+i* specifies the *i*\\ th child of *d*.

    I.e., every tree position is either a single index *i*,
    specifying ``tree[i]``; or a sequence *i1, i2, ..., iN*,
    specifying ``tree[i1][i2]...[iN]``.

    Construct a new tree.  This constructor can be called in one
    of two ways:

    - ``Tree(label, children)`` constructs a new tree with the
        specified label and list of children.

    - ``Tree.fromstring(s)`` constructs a new tree by parsing the string ``s``.
