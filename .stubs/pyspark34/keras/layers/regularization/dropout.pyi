class Dropout(base_layer.BaseRandomLayer):
    """Applies Dropout to the input.

    The Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of `rate`
    at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.
    Inputs not set to 0 are scaled up by 1/(1 - rate) such that the sum over
    all inputs is unchanged.

    Note that the Dropout layer only applies when `training` is set to True
    such that no values are dropped during inference. When using `model.fit`,
    `training` will be appropriately set to True automatically, and in other
    contexts, you can set the kwarg explicitly to True when calling the layer.

    (This is in contrast to setting `trainable=False` for a Dropout layer.
    `trainable` does not affect the layer's behavior, as Dropout does
    not have any variables/weights that can be frozen during training.)

    Args:
      rate: Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop.
      noise_shape: 1D integer tensor representing the shape of the
        binary dropout mask that will be multiplied with the input.
        For instance, if your inputs have shape
        `(batch_size, timesteps, features)` and
        you want the dropout mask to be the same for all timesteps,
        you can use `noise_shape=(batch_size, 1, features)`.
      seed: A Python integer to use as random seed.

    Call arguments:
      inputs: Input tensor (of any rank).
      training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
        training mode (adding dropout) or in inference mode (doing nothing).
