class LayerNormalization(Layer):
    """Layer normalization layer (Ba et al., 2016).

    Normalize the activations of the previous layer for each given example in a
    batch independently, rather than across a batch like Batch Normalization.
    i.e. applies a transformation that maintains the mean activation within each
    example close to 0 and the activation standard deviation close to 1.

    Given a tensor `inputs`, moments are calculated and normalization
    is performed across the axes specified in `axis`.

    Example:

    >>> data = tf.constant(np.arange(10).reshape(5, 2) * 10, dtype=tf.float32)
    >>> print(data)
    tf.Tensor(
    [[ 0. 10.]
     [20. 30.]
     [40. 50.]
     [60. 70.]
     [80. 90.]], shape=(5, 2), dtype=float32)

    >>> layer = tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization(axis=1)
    >>> output = layer(data)
    >>> print(output)
    tf.Tensor(
    [[-1. 1.]
     [-1. 1.]
     [-1. 1.]
     [-1. 1.]
     [-1. 1.]], shape=(5, 2), dtype=float32)

    Notice that with Layer Normalization the normalization happens across the
    axes *within* each example, rather than across different examples in the
    batch.

    If `scale` or `center` are enabled, the layer will scale the normalized
    outputs by broadcasting them with a trainable variable `gamma`, and center
    the outputs by broadcasting with a trainable variable `beta`. `gamma` will
    default to a ones tensor and `beta` will default to a zeros tensor, so that
    centering and scaling are no-ops before training has begun.

    So, with scaling and centering enabled the normalization equations
    are as follows:

    Let the intermediate activations for a mini-batch to be the `inputs`.

    For each sample `x_i` in `inputs` with `k` features, we compute the mean and
    variance of the sample:

    ```python
    mean_i = sum(x_i[j] for j in range(k)) / k
    var_i = sum((x_i[j] - mean_i) ** 2 for j in range(k)) / k
    ```

    and then compute a normalized `x_i_normalized`, including a small factor
    `epsilon` for numerical stability.

    ```python
    x_i_normalized = (x_i - mean_i) / sqrt(var_i + epsilon)
    ```

    And finally `x_i_normalized ` is linearly transformed by `gamma` and `beta`,
    which are learned parameters:

    ```python
    output_i = x_i_normalized * gamma + beta
    ```

    `gamma` and `beta` will span the axes of `inputs` specified in `axis`, and
    this part of the inputs' shape must be fully defined.

    For example:

    >>> layer = tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization(axis=[1, 2, 3])
    >>> layer.build([5, 20, 30, 40])
    >>> print(layer.beta.shape)
    (20, 30, 40)
    >>> print(layer.gamma.shape)
    (20, 30, 40)

    Note that other implementations of layer normalization may choose to define
    `gamma` and `beta` over a separate set of axes from the axes being
    normalized across. For example, Group Normalization
    ([Wu et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08494)) with group size of 1
    corresponds to a Layer Normalization that normalizes across height, width,
    and channel and has `gamma` and `beta` span only the channel dimension.
    So, this Layer Normalization implementation will not match a Group
    Normalization layer with group size set to 1.

    Args:
      axis: Integer or List/Tuple. The axis or axes to normalize across.
        Typically this is the features axis/axes. The left-out axes are
        typically the batch axis/axes. This argument defaults to `-1`, the last
        dimension in the input.
      epsilon: Small float added to variance to avoid dividing by zero. Defaults
        to 1e-3
      center: If True, add offset of `beta` to normalized tensor. If False,
        `beta` is ignored. Defaults to True.
      scale: If True, multiply by `gamma`. If False, `gamma` is not used.
        Defaults to True. When the next layer is linear (also e.g. `nn.relu`),
        this can be disabled since the scaling will be done by the next layer.
      beta_initializer: Initializer for the beta weight. Defaults to zeros.
      gamma_initializer: Initializer for the gamma weight. Defaults to ones.
      beta_regularizer: Optional regularizer for the beta weight. None by
        default.
      gamma_regularizer: Optional regularizer for the gamma weight. None by
        default.
      beta_constraint: Optional constraint for the beta weight. None by default.
      gamma_constraint: Optional constraint for the gamma weight. None by
        default.

    Input shape:
      Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument `input_shape` (tuple of
      integers, does not include the samples axis) when using this layer as the
      first layer in a model.

    Output shape:
      Same shape as input.
