class Conv2DTranspose(Conv2D):
    '''Transposed convolution layer (sometimes called Deconvolution).

    The need for transposed convolutions generally arises
    from the desire to use a transformation going in the opposite direction
    of a normal convolution, i.e., from something that has the shape of the
    output of some convolution to something that has the shape of its input
    while maintaining a connectivity pattern that is compatible with
    said convolution.

    When using this layer as the first layer in a model,
    provide the keyword argument `input_shape`
    (tuple of integers or `None`, does not include the sample axis),
    e.g. `input_shape=(128, 128, 3)` for 128x128 RGB pictures
    in `data_format="channels_last"`.

    Args:
      filters: Integer, the dimensionality of the output space
        (i.e. the number of output filters in the convolution).
      kernel_size: An integer or tuple/list of 2 integers, specifying the
        height and width of the 2D convolution window.
        Can be a single integer to specify the same value for
        all spatial dimensions.
      strides: An integer or tuple/list of 2 integers,
        specifying the strides of the convolution along the height and width.
        Can be a single integer to specify the same value for
        all spatial dimensions.
        Specifying any stride value != 1 is incompatible with specifying
        any `dilation_rate` value != 1.
      padding: one of `"valid"` or `"same"` (case-insensitive).
        `"valid"` means no padding. `"same"` results in padding with zeros
        evenly to the left/right or up/down of the input such that output has
        the same height/width dimension as the input.
      output_padding: An integer or tuple/list of 2 integers,
        specifying the amount of padding along the height and width
        of the output tensor.
        Can be a single integer to specify the same value for all
        spatial dimensions.
        The amount of output padding along a given dimension must be
        lower than the stride along that same dimension.
        If set to `None` (default), the output shape is inferred.
      data_format: A string,
        one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`.
        The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs.
        `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape
        `(batch_size, height, width, channels)` while `channels_first`
        corresponds to inputs with shape
        `(batch_size, channels, height, width)`.
        It defaults to the `image_data_format` value found in your
        Keras config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`.
        If you never set it, then it will be "channels_last".
      dilation_rate: an integer, specifying the dilation rate for all spatial
        dimensions for dilated convolution. Specifying different dilation rates
        for different dimensions is not supported.
        Currently, specifying any `dilation_rate` value != 1 is
        incompatible with specifying any stride value != 1.
      activation: Activation function to use.
        If you don\'t specify anything, no activation is applied
        (see `keras.activations`).
      use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
      kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix
        (see `keras.initializers`). Defaults to \'glorot_uniform\'.
      bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector
        (see `keras.initializers`). Defaults to \'zeros\'.
      kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
        the `kernel` weights matrix (see `keras.regularizers`).
      bias_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the bias vector
        (see `keras.regularizers`).
      activity_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
        the output of the layer (its "activation") (see `keras.regularizers`).
      kernel_constraint: Constraint function applied to the kernel matrix
        (see `keras.constraints`).
      bias_constraint: Constraint function applied to the bias vector
        (see `keras.constraints`).

    Input shape:
      4D tensor with shape:
      `(batch_size, channels, rows, cols)` if data_format=\'channels_first\'
      or 4D tensor with shape:
      `(batch_size, rows, cols, channels)` if data_format=\'channels_last\'.

    Output shape:
      4D tensor with shape:
      `(batch_size, filters, new_rows, new_cols)` if
      data_format=\'channels_first\'
      or 4D tensor with shape:
      `(batch_size, new_rows, new_cols, filters)` if
      data_format=\'channels_last\'.  `rows` and `cols` values might have changed
      due to padding.
      If `output_padding` is specified:
      ```
      new_rows = ((rows - 1) * strides[0] + kernel_size[0] - 2 * padding[0] +
      output_padding[0])
      new_cols = ((cols - 1) * strides[1] + kernel_size[1] - 2 * padding[1] +
      output_padding[1])
      ```

    Returns:
      A tensor of rank 4 representing
      `activation(conv2dtranspose(inputs, kernel) + bias)`.

    Raises:
      ValueError: if `padding` is "causal".
      ValueError: when both `strides` > 1 and `dilation_rate` > 1.
