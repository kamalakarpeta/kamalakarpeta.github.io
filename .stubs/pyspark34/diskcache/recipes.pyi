def memoize_stampede(cache, expire, name: Incomplete | None = None, typed: bool = False, tag: Incomplete | None = None, beta: int = 1, ignore=()):
    """Memoizing cache decorator with cache stampede protection.

    Cache stampedes are a type of system overload that can occur when parallel
    computing systems using memoization come under heavy load. This behaviour
    is sometimes also called dog-piling, cache miss storm, cache choking, or
    the thundering herd problem.

    The memoization decorator implements cache stampede protection through
    early recomputation. Early recomputation of function results will occur
    probabilistically before expiration in a background thread of
    execution. Early probabilistic recomputation is based on research by
    Vattani, A.; Chierichetti, F.; Lowenstein, K. (2015), Optimal Probabilistic
    Cache Stampede Prevention, VLDB, pp. 886-897, ISSN 2150-8097

    If name is set to None (default), the callable name will be determined
    automatically.

    If typed is set to True, function arguments of different types will be
    cached separately. For example, f(3) and f(3.0) will be treated as distinct
    calls with distinct results.

    The original underlying function is accessible through the `__wrapped__`
    attribute. This is useful for introspection, for bypassing the cache, or
    for rewrapping the function with a different cache.

    >>> from diskcache import Cache
    >>> cache = Cache()
    >>> @memoize_stampede(cache, expire=1)

    ...     if number == 0:
    ...         return 0
    ...     elif number == 1:
    ...         return 1
    ...     else:
    ...         return fib(number - 1) + fib(number - 2)
    >>> print(fib(100))
    354224848179261915075

    An additional `__cache_key__` attribute can be used to generate the cache
    key used for the given arguments.

    >>> key = fib.__cache_key__(100)
    >>> del cache[key]
