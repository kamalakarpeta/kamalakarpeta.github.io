    """Wrap the original CPU ufunc/gufunc with a parallel dispatcher.
    This function will wrap gufuncs and ufuncs something like.

    Args
    ----
    ctx
        numba's codegen context

    info: (library, env, name)
        inner function info

    sig
        type signature of the gufunc

    inner_ndim
        inner dimension of the gufunc (this is len(sig.args) in the case of a
        ufunc)

    Returns
    -------
    wrapper_info : (library, env, name)
        The info for the gufunc wrapper.

    Details
    -------

    The kernel signature looks like this:

    void kernel(char **args, npy_intp *dimensions, npy_intp* steps, void* data)

    args - the input arrays + output arrays
    dimensions - the dimensions of the arrays
    steps - the step size for the array (this is like sizeof(type))
    data - any additional data

    The parallel backend then stages multiple calls to this kernel concurrently
    across a number of threads. Practically, for each item of work, the backend
    duplicates `dimensions` and adjusts the first entry to reflect the size of
    the item of work, it also forms up an array of pointers into the args for
    offsets to read/write from/to with respect to its position in the items of
    work. This allows the same kernel to be used for each item of work, with
    simply adjusted reads/writes/domain sizes and is safe by virtue of the
    domain partitioning.

    NOTE: The execution backend is passed the requested thread count, but it can
    choose to ignore it (TBB)!
