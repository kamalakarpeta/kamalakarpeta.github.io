        * Looks for `typed_getitem` and wires them up to loop body version
          specific variables or, if possible, directly writes in their constant
          value at their use site.

        Args:
        - switch_ir, the switch table with SENTINELS as generated by
          self.gen_switch

        - dont_replace, variables that should not be renamed (to handle
          references to variables that are incoming at the loop head/escaping at
          the loop exit.
        - switch_data, the switch table data used to generated the switch_ir,
          can be generated by self.analyse_tuple.

        Returns:
